We message/email you with the rough time that it will go ahead on the day and you will only find out who you will be going against at the time the bracket starts. It will be a mixed category so you will go with mixed age, weight and belt and a choice if you go Gi or No Gi, so you could choose Gi and go against an opponent with NoGi . This will be using the smoothcomp technology so no changes can be made on the day. Over 18's only!
