## Description
Our tournament is a family friendly, competitor, coach oriented competition. The goal is to prepare each individual for higher level competitions. We value the spotlight being on each match. We run one at a time so each competitor gets the focus they deserve. This enables the coaches and instructors to support each member of their academy after all the hard work they put in throughout the year. A homegrown tournament for our beautiful Big Island of Hawai'i.
