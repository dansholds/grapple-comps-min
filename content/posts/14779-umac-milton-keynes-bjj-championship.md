We are introducing a 'Ghost Bracket'. This is an invisible category which anyone from white to purple belt can sign up for and we will only make it visible to you on the day. We will message/email you with the rough time that it will go ahead on the day and you will only find out who you will be going against at the time the bracket starts. It will be a mixed category so you will go with mixed age, weight and belt and a choice if you go Gi or No Gi, so you could choose Gi and go against an opponent with NoGi . This will be using the smoothcomp technology so no changes can be made on the day. Over 18's only! 


- A 'round robin' format will be used for all categories with 3 participants, this is to ensure that all competitors will have a minimum of 2 x fights.


Competition specific rules for Masters brown/black no Gi:


- Heel hooks are allowed.


Entry requirements:


In order to enter into the Absolute division you will first need to register for the respective Male or Female Gi/No Gi division. 


During your application, please be sure to enter the correct weight, age and experience level. If incorrect details are entered this can cause us unnecessary delays on the day if we need to correct them and could result in disqualification.

Merging divisions:


We reserve the right to merge divisions after the registration deadline in the unlikely event that you are the only competitor in your registered division group.
