COACHES


Arrival and Entry- Coaches are permitted to enter the venue from 9-00am through
the spectator entrance only.
  


        Each team will receive a limited number of complimentary coach
     passes, allocated based on the number of individual athletes registered
     under the team/gym via Smoothcomp.
      

        These passes are distributed on a first-come, first-served basis
     at the reception on the day of the event.
      

        Photo ID and Smoothcomp ID (confirming your gym affiliation) are
     mandatory for all coaches. Coaches must also be at least a BJJ Blue Belt.
      



        Passes are distributed on a first-come,
     first-served basis and are not pre-assigned.
      

        It is the responsibility of each team to decide
     who will use the passes.
     *Please note there is not one free coach pass per athlete.
      

        Abuse or arguments- Staff will not tolerate abuse or arguments over
     pass distribution. If issues arise, individuals may be refused entry.

    ***NEW FOR 2025***AAA (Access All Areas) - We appreciate that having this many individual athletes or more to deal with for a head coach can be overwhelming and we want to work with the head coach to make their day and our day as smooth as possible.This pass will be allocated to the HEAD COACH ONLY and they will have a little more elasticity on the day. This pass cannot however be abused and passed to anyone else and must still where possible abide by our coach rules or it will be revoked.Any additional coaches beyond
the allocated passes will be classified as spectators and must pay the standard
spectator fee, which is payable on the day at the door and then must coach from
the spectator area.
