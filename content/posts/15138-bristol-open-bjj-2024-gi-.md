## Description
We organise and hold Brazilian Jiu Jitsu tournaments in the United Kingdom and Ireland since 2006. All of our tournaments follow the International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation ruleset, and are refereed by experienced BJJ referees and competitors.


The Bristol Open Brazilian Jiu jitsu tournament follows the IBJJF tournaments format, rules and guideline. We recommend all competitors and coaches to be familiar with the IBJJF rules book. For further info please visit https://ibjjf.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IBJJF_Rules_Book_v5.1_en-US.pdf


In order to avoid disappointments, all competitors must be on weight and ready to compete at least 2h prior to their scheduled fight. Please bear in mind that smoothcomp provides a live schedule where times of fight may vary throughout the competition day, so it's very important that competitors check their scheduled bracket regularly on the day of competition. 


We aim to release brackets and schedule 48h prior to the competition day so please bear that in mind before contacting us. 


We do not tolerate bad behaviour towards staff, referees, coaches, parents, team mates or other competitors in our tournaments. The competitors or coach, as well as their team, will risk disqualification from the whole tournament if necessary.


We offer no refunds, unless there's no one else to compete in your division.


Any queries please email us at [email protected].


Good luck to all competitors,
