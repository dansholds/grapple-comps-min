Ruleset Summary


UKGCC rules focus on having you win by submission. 


A simple point system rewards the most dominant player even when a submission is not achieved.


If it comes to ref decision, the ref will award victory to the most dominant player, attacking, sweeping, or passing guard. Ref decision is final.


There is a penalty for stalling.



Win by submission, points or ref decision tiebreaker


One point back take


One point mount


One point for a failed submission attempt


One point when the adversary exceeds the 20-second stall limit


No overtime


No advantages


6-min match



Your game strategy should be based on getting to a submission and controlling the opponent to get to one, not just for the sake of positional control itself.
