## Description
Get ready to put your jiu jitsu to the test at the Charleston Fall
Championship! Join us atÂ Charleston Area Convention Center on September 28th for one of
the biggest tournaments of the season.


No matter your age or skill level, we have the right division for you.
And with custom medals awarded to the top three athletes in each
division, you'll have the chance to showcase your skills and earn
recognition for your hard work.


If you're a more experienced athlete, you'll be aiming for the prized
NJJF Championship Belt, which will be awarded to the first place winners
of any advanced division.


For those seeking the toughest challenge, the nogi absolute division
will be a true battleground where only the best of the best will emerge
victorious.


At the end of the tournament team points will be calculated to determine
the top three teams in the youth and adult categories, as well as the
one overall team champion. All seven teams will receive an award banner
to display in their academy, and the first-place winning teams will take
home a custom trophy.


This is your chance to take your game to the next level this fall! So
get in the gym and get ready to earn your place on the NJJF podium.
We'll see you on the mat!
