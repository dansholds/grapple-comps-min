## Description
This tournament is the first of the new Spokane Submission Series, a tournament that is committed to giving back to our athletes! This tournament will be held in Downtown Spokane at the Spokane Convention Center! This year we are excited to offer prizes for athletes who compete at all 3 of our events (Platinum Competitors), top 20 athletes with the best sinning record, and a special trip package for 1 lucky person drawn from the list of our Platinum Competitors! Our tournament series will end with our third event on September 28th at the Riverfront Park Pavillion in Downtown Spokane where we will also have our award ceremony and drawing! You do not want to miss this tournament series as we bring a unique competition experience to the Northwest that no one has seen before!


Spokane Submission Challenge is a Submission only tournament (within normal regulation time). Competitors can win by executing a legal (within rules) submission, an overtime score, or referee decision. Unsportsmanlike conduct will not be tolerated at this tournament, and tournament officials can, and will disqualify any competitor at any time for inappropriate behavior. Any spectators displaying unsportsmanlike conduct will be removed from the tournament. We look forward to continuing to build a strong reputation in our Jiu-Jitsu community. Any questions can be directed to Adam Smith at [email protected]. Thank you to everyone involved in this experience!  


Registration


Competitors will be bracketed with the best available matches. In the case of no other athletes registered, competitors will automatically be combined with the best bracket either above or below the weight class or belt class. Youth competitors will not be combined with a bracket any more than 10lbs over their weight class without parental consent.
