## Description
Welcome to the Colorado Combat Championships!


What is it?


The CCC is a Submission Only, Round Robin Tournament, with a points based Overtime.


How to Win the Fight!


Submissions! Get a submission and you win!If no submissions occur during the fight, it will go to an Overtime (OT).The OT period will include points as well as submissions.Points will be based on the ADCC ruleset.Whoever has the most points by the end of OT wins the fight.If no points or submissions occur by the end of OT,the referee will make a decision based on Offensive Submission Attacks.


Submission Attacks come in 2 Categories-   Locked-In Attacks "Lock-Ins" -Defending competitor is forced put all effort into defending   (Generally for 2 seconds or more).   Attempted Attacks "Attempts" -Defending competitor is affected, however not Locked-In   (Generally 1 second or less)Locked-In Submission Attacks reign supreme.(If Competitor One has 1 Lock-In and 0 Attempts, while Competitor Two has 100 Attempts and 0 Lock-Ins, Competitor One wins)


How to Win the Tournament!


The format is Round Robin. You will fight nearly everyone (if not everyone) in your division.Each Victory earns you points! - Submission Wins- 6 points - Point Wins- 3 points - Referee Decision Wins- 1 point


Whoever has the most points at the end of the bracket wins!


Ruleset!
