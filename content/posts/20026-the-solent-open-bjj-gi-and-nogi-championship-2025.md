you've been training for a while and have a solid foundation in BJJ, the
beginners' category is where you can put your skills to the test. Expect
intense matches and the opportunity to learn from fellow practitioners.
  

    3. Intermediate (2 Years - 4 Years)- For
those who have honed their techniques and are ready to take their game to the
next level, the intermediate category offers a challenging environment. Compete
against skilled opponents and push your limits on the mats.
  

    4. Advanced (4+ Years)- The pinnacle of
competition at Mat Mania, the advanced category is reserved for highly skilled
practitioners. Prepare for intense battles and witness the highest level of
technique and strategy as the best of the best go head-to-head.
