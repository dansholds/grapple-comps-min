## Description
Entry is NOW OPEN for the Pro Sport Grappling South East Pro Gi & NoGi BJJ Championships in Brighton on Sunday 18th February 2024.


Moulsecoomb Leisure Centre, Moulsecoomb Way, Brighton, BN2 4PB - Sunday 18th February 2024


FIGHT MORE - PAY LESS


Same great price but double the matches! Sounds good? As Bjj Black Belts we, the owners of Pro Sport Grappling know how important mat time is and how frustrating it can be when you only get one match at an event. That’s why for 2024 we aim to give all competitors a minimum of 2 matches per division, even if you lose your first match! So, for example if you enter both Gi and NoGi divisions we aim to give you at least 4 matches*. We also discount the additional division so it’s even better value for money.


Also don’t forget to order your FREE event T-Shirt supplied by Smash Jiu Jitsu Clothing when you register.
