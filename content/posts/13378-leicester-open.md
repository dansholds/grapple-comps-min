## Description
IBJJF Rules...but no advantages!


The Leicester Open will be competed under IBJJF rules, but without advantages. We believe that you should not be penalised for preventing a takedown or pass, and escaping a submission attempt - no matter how close it gets. These can also be subjective, awarded by the referees discretion.


By removing advantages, you are merited for completing your passes, takedowns and submissions, and that's it!


That being said, if a match ends in a draw, the referee will make a decision on who wins based on the entire match.


Official ruleset can be found here.


Rules Meeting - 9:30am


Oliver Geddes - Head Referee


No one wants to lose a match on a controversial decison, that’s why at the Leicester Open we are taking the refereeing of our competition very seriously.


We are excited to announce Oliver Geddes as our head ref in March and welcome him to the LO team. Oliver is a 3rd degree black belt under Roger Gracie and has extensive experience refereeing on Polaris and coordinating for the AJP. He will oversee on the day of the competition to ensure high level officiating.
