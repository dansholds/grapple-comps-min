## Description
The rules for the tournament-


Kids matches will be 5 minutes Submissions only!


Kids Brackets get guaranteed at least 2 matches


Teens will be 10 minutes Submissions only!


Double Elimination brackets


Get your opponent to tap out within the round time and win that match. There will be matches that do not get a "tap out" within the round time. In that case we will go to over time (OT). We will do a sort of penalty, sudden death, (Like soccer) shootout. It will be put into 1 overtime round for regular rounds and 3 overtime rounds for the finals.


Overtime Round- Athletes have a choice of back control or Armbar position from mount. The Athletes will be placed with one having the other's back with both hooks in and a seatbelt (over, under hands). They will try to finish their opponent while the other tries to escape. If that athlete finishes then we will set them the other way around and the other athlete will try to finish as well. If the second does not finish, they lose and first athlete wins. If the second does finish then the winner is the one with the fasted finishing time. Now if neither of the athletes finished the winner will be the one with the fastest escape time.
