  Event Day Instructions

        Match start times are dynamic and will be updated throughout the day on Smoothcomp.
      



        Continuously check your match times, as brackets may shift due to submissions, no-shows, or other unforeseen circumstances.
      



        Ensure you are at the mat, with weigh-in completed, when your match is set to start. If you are not present, your name will be called three times.
      



        No-shows will be disqualified without a refund.
      


  Weigh Ins


    Weigh ins will be available during the whole day.
  

    You don't need to wear a Gi to weigh in even if your fight is in the Gi.
  

    There is no weigh allowance and not making weight will result in a disqualification without refund. 
  

    You can change your weight within the change window publish on Smoothcomp.

    Lower belts that want to compete at upper belt level can choose to do so but organisers will not merge them automatically if their division is empty. Brown and Black belts compete in the same division.
  

    Coloured belts in other grappling disciplines cannot sign up at White belt, even if they are a Jiu Jitsu white belt. If you are not sure where to sign up to, please reach out. Our referees are Jiu Jitsu black belts with IBJJF accreditation and we take sandbagging very seriously and you may be disqualified without refund when you are caught competing at a skill level lower than yours.
  

  For under 16, belts are split as follow-

Grey

Yellow
BGG Yellow belts, all levels


Orange

Green
BJJ Green belts, all levels




    The organisers will never merge belt levels except for Orange and Green. Lower belts can compete with upper belts only upon explicit decision of their parent/guardian.
  

    Merging by weight would only happen by one weight division difference.

If you are in doubt, feel free to reach out, we are happy to help. Our referees are Jiu Jitsu black belts with IBJJF accreditation and we take sandbagging very seriously and you may be disqualified without refund when you are caught competing at a skill level lower than yours.

  Admittance


    Coaches are permitted to enter the venue exclusively through the spectator entrance.
  

    Each team will be provided with a specific number of coach passes, which is determined by the number of individual athletes registered from their team/gym on Smoothcomp.

        0-5 individual athletes = 1 coach pass
      

        6-10 individual athletes = 2 coach passes
      

        11-15 individual athletes = 3 coach passes
      

        16-20 individual athletes = 4 coach passes
      

        21+ individual athletes = 5 coach passes
