Changing divisions/amendments-


Any amendments to your original application, including changes to your registered division needs to be either updated on your Smoothcomp registration or emailed to us by 18/07/2024. Brackets and divisions will be set up by 19/07/2024 @ 9am,  Once we reach the limit of approved registrations we may close all entries early you will receive an email when we have reached 90% of capacity.


Merging divisions-


We reserve the right to merge divisions after the registration deadline in the unlikely event that you are the only competitor in your registered division group, so please move up or email us and we will do it for you before dead line, if you do not move up we will move you and after brackets are published no changes will be allowed.


Weighing in-


Weighing in takes place on the day of the competition starting from 9am and must be completed at the latest 1 hour before your scheduled division start time. Doors open 9am. You must have officially weighed in 1 hour before your division time and have made the weight. No kids will be disqualified for not making weight, you will be moved up a division if you fail to make weight, if the next division is running already you will have the opportunity to move up again depending on next division available, so it is in your best interest to be in the right division.  


There will be at least 3 staff members with scales at weigh in. This is to avoid any inconvenient queues. We will try our best to avoid queues as we want your experience to be great from start to finish! 


* The weigh-in is to be done once only and whilst wearing your Gi.* you will not need to weigh in for NO GI if you are registed for both* 


If you only register for NO GI you need to weight in as normal with NO Gi


Hot food, hot & cold drinks, the amazing Brazilian Açai and Clothes Stalls available for everyone!
