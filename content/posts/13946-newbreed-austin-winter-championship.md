## Description
NJJF makes it's return to the capital of Texas for the Austin Winter
Championship! Held at theÂ Premier Athletic Complex on February 24th, this is
one tournament you do not want to miss!


Whether you're a seasoned pro or a newcomer to the sport, we've got you
covered with both gi and nogi divisions for all ages and skill levels.
To recognize your hard work, custom medals will be awarded to the top
three athletes in each division.


For the ultimate accolade, first place winners of any advanced division
will receive the prestigious NJJF Championship Belt. And if you're
looking for a real challenge, you can put your resolve to the test in
the nogi absolute division.


At NEWBREED, we believe that Jiu-Jitsu is a team sport as well as an
individual one. That's why we calculate team points to determine the top
three teams in the youth and adult categories, as well as the overall
team champion. All seven teams receive an award banner to hang in their
academy, and the first place winning teams receive a custom trophy to
commemorate their victory.


So don't miss your chance to be part of the action at the Austin Winter
Championship. Sign up now and put your jiu-jitsu skills to the test.
We'll see you on the mat!
