You only have to be at the event 1 hour before you fight to sign in, warm up and be ready to be weighed in.  You don't have to be there all day, however you are welcome to arrive early and stay as long as you would like.


FIGHT TIMES


We will only know fight times once registration has closed and brackets have been created. We estimate to have this information around 6th June.


MERGES


We will be looking at the competitor list on 2nd June and will start to make any necessary merges.  Ideally there should be at least 4 in a category in case someone does not show up, so fights can still go ahead. You also have the opportunity to merge/move yourself into another category on Check Day.


Moving Age Category for Adults - You can only move yourself to younger age groups.Weight Category - You can only move yourself to heavier categories or to ones you know you can definitely make weight for. 


VENUE


Littledown Centre has plenty of parking. There are showers and lockers available.  They also have a cafe on site.  There will be a lovely Acai stall in the main hall where the fights are.


PARKING


The first 3 hours are free parking at the Littledown Centre. Please purchase extra parking before the free 3 hours runs out otherwise you risk receiving an automatic fine from their camera system. Signs are displayed in the car park on how to purchase parking if needed.
