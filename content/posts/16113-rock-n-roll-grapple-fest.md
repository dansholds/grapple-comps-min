## Description
The Legendary Godfather of Jiu-Jitsu in the Southwest, Master Carlos Machado is bringing a fun, kids only jiu-jitsu tournament to Dallas, Texas.


Rock N Roll Grapple fest theme will provide an experience for all who attend, featuring Gi & No-Gi divisions! Master Carlos Machado's tournament provides a unique scoring system developed to offer an opportunity for every style of grappler out there to showcase their skills. This rule set strongly encourages submissions and gives points for dominant positions.


Rock N Roll Grapple fest is a double elimination format where the first 2 minutes of each round will be submission only.
