## Description
📝 Registration & Application- To apply for a spot in Theory Grappling Invitational 4, please provide the following information- Age, Weight Class, Rank, Gi/NoGi Preference. Registration Deadline is May 6, 2024. All applicants will be contacted by May 7, 2024, to confirm inclusion on the event card. If selected, you will be matched with an opponent of similar weight, age, and skill level, ensuring a fair and exciting competition for all participants. 


📌 Competitor Match-Ups- Competitors will be paired with opponents of similar weight and skill levels. These weight divisions will be based on Grappling Industries' standards in their events. The same procedure applies to weighing in and weight allowances. If you do not weigh in at the agreed-upon weight division 60 minutes before your match time, you will be disqualified, and no refund will be issued.   


📸 Promotional Materials- Each match-up will receive a customized Match Flyer for promoting the event on social media. Additionally, all matches will be filmed in HD and competitors will be provided with a private, unlisted YouTube link to their match afterward. There will also be photography being taken of the event as well. 


🎟️ Spectators- Admission to the event is just $5 Cash at the Door. Due to limited seating, we kindly ask spectators to sit along the edge of the mat area to ensure a clear view for everyone. We encourage all spectators to maintain a positive and supportive environment for the participants by refraining from negative remarks. Any disruptive behavior may result in a warning or potential removal from the event. Please keep noise and conversations to a low whisper so competitors can focus and listen to their coaches.


📣 Coaching & Corner Support- Each competitor is allowed to have a coach in their corner during the match, offering guidance and encouragement. However, coaches must prioritize their participant's safety and well-being. Any advice that might put a participant at risk, such as suggesting questionable tactics or encouraging them not to tap out during a submission, could result in disqualification for their participant. Coaches should act responsibly and ensure they prioritize the safety and well-being of their participants above all else.


⏰ Match Schedule & Arrival Time-The first match of Theory Grappling Invitational 4 will commence at 10 AM sharp. Competitors are advised to arrive at least 60 minutes prior to their scheduled match to account for any matches that may conclude earlier than expected. They should also check in upon arrival so that we can continue to match, knowing Competitors have arrived. 


⏱️ Match Duration- Each match will last 10 Minutes (Youth 5 Minutes), allowing competitors ample time to showcase their skills and adapt to their opponents. This time frame also tests cardiovascular conditioning, leading to potential opportunities for both offense and defense.


🥋 Victory Method 1 - Submission- Jiu-Jitsu is a martial art where the ultimate goal is to emerge victorious by incapacitating your opponent. Points can be controversial and may lead to stalling or gaming of a system. To avoid such issues, victories are determined by successful submissions, rather than points, or the following method- judges.


👨‍⚖️ Victory Method 2 - Judges' Decision- If no submission occurs within the 10-minute time frame, the winner will be determined by a panel of three impartial judges. They will consider factors such as positional dominance/progression, submission threats, and stalling attempts (holding an opponent for an extended amount of time without advancement towards a more dominant position or submission finish). With 10 minutes provided to secure victory, along with three judges providing unbiased decisions towards a specific competitor, disputes should be minimized.


🏅 Prizes- Match Victories earn winners a medal/prize (available at the event's Prize Table), Submission Victories are awarded an additional $50 for Adults, and the Best Event Submission earns a bonus $100 (Adults) and a special Trophy (Youth/Adults)!


🏆 Claiming Awards- If you secure a victory by submission, we encourage you to remain at the event until the conclusion, as you may be eligible for the Best Submission Award/Trophy. If you are unable to stay or need to leave early, don't worry! You will be contacted later to arrange a time to collect your award at the Theory Jiu-Jitsu Studio



NEW – $50 (Refundable) Reservation Fee- The $50 Reservation Fee will be required once a match has been created for competitors (via Venmo/Paypal) to reserve your event spot (link will be provided in confirmation e-mail). This Fee will be refunded after a successful weigh-in or before June 1st (if cancelling off the card). At THEORY Grappling Invitational, we elevate the competition experience to mirror the professionalism and intensity of premier athletic events. Unlike traditional tournaments where multiple competitors in a division can mean flexibility in matchups, our showcase event format pairs individual athletes in a one-on-one, scheduled match, akin to professional MMA events. This structure emphasizes the importance of commitment, preparation, and respect for your opponent. Each competitor spends significant time training, planning, and possibly traveling specifically for this match. Not showing up or failing to make weight affects the event’s schedule and disrespects the time and effort your opponent has invested. With this understanding of mutual respect and professionalism, we set forth our registration and refund policies.


Withdrawal Deadline- If you need to cancel your participation for any reason, you can do so until June 1st. Cancel before this date, and you’ll receive a full refund of your $50 reservation fee.


Non-Refundable After June 1st- The reservation fee becomes non-refundable starting June 1st. We understand that life happens, but by now, we’re finalizing details based on the number of registered participants. Your commitment helps us create a better experience for everyone. 


Refund at Weigh-In- If you attend the event and successfully weigh in for your match on time (60 minutes before your scheduled time), your $50 reservation fee will be refunded within a few business days. It’s our way of saying thank you for following through with your commitment. Please read and understand this policy before registering. By submitting your registration and fee, you agree to these terms. We aim to ensure a fair, competitive, and enjoyable experience for all involved.
