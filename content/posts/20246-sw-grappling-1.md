What are the rules?


    We will be using the IBJJF white and blue belt rules. We are asking our referees for some leniency in the rules. We do not want to be disqualifying competitors, we will give warnings out to start with. If the same rule break keeps happening in the match, there will be a disqualification. We will also be using English terminology instead of Portuguese. If people go off the edge of the mat area, we will try our best to reset the match in the middle of the mat in the same position. If this is not possible the match will be restarted standing. 
  

How do the weigh ins work?


    Regardless of whether you are doing gi, no gi or both you only need to weigh in once, wearing just shorts and a t-shirt. We will allow a small amount of leeway with your weight to allow for scale differences, but if it is too high you will be disqualified. You can change your weight class on smoothcomp until 4th April.
  

    You can weigh in as soon as you get to the venue for the competition, please be weighed in an hour before your first match of the day to avoid delays to the schedule. Once weighed in you can go eat and rehydrate then start getting warmed up for your matches. 
  

How do we check or change our own entry? 


    You can do this on Smoothcomp. The system allows you to make changes yourself. They have a support section you can search if you get stuck. 
  

Are there any uniform requirements?


    You can wear whatever colour gi you like, but we ask that you roughly meet the IBJJF sizing requirements. BJJ gis only no judo gis will be allowed. 
  

    Spats, VTs, grappling shorts and rash guards are fine for nogi. There are no ranked colour requirements. Please do not try to compete in a t-shirt (you will be asked to change), nothing with pockets, you can not wear wrestling boots or compete topless.
  

I’m ill/injured/have changed my mind, can I cancel my entry?


    Yes you can cancel for a full refund 3 weeks out the from the competition 22ndMarch. After that you can cancel for a 100% coupon refund to use on a future event until 4th April. If you do end up being alone in your division after registration has ended and deadlines have been met. Also, after the brackets have been released we will refund you if no suitable merge is available. 
  

Can I coach my students? 


    Yes we are allowing coaches mat side to coach their students. We are just asking people to please leave the area if it is busy, and you do not have anyone competing on the mat. Our runners and mat staff will ask you to clear the area. 
  

Does the venue have parking?


    Yes, the YMCA Plymouth has plenty of parking. There is also additional parking available at the school opposite you can use. 
  

What are the timings going to be on the day?


    We are aiming to run matches from 09-00-17-00, but we can’t give more detailed times until we release the brackets. Brackets will be released 48 hours before the competition. 
  

    Please be at the venue an hour before your first match, in case your match is moved forward. First matches will be from 09-00, weigh ins will be open from 08-15. If you are first match on come to the front of the queue.
  

What are the deadlines on the week of competition?


    You can check and change your weight class until 4th April. This is also your last chance to cancel for a coupon refund.
  

    If there are less than 3 of you in your division, the likelihood is that we will merge you up one weight category (to get you more matches at the competition). If you do not wish to be merged, please let us know when you register or add a note to your registration with more details. 
  

    Please be aware that even if you appear to be alone in your division on the week of the competition, we may merge others into it, even if we don’t move you.
