BRACKET COMBINATIONS-


After the deadline to edit registration info on April 12, 11-59 PM, competitors who do not have anyone in their division will be combined into another appropriate division. All competitors who remain alone in their divisions once brackets are finalized, and have no combinations available to them, they will receive a full coupon credit for entry to any future Kearney Combat Sports Tournament events.


REGISTRATION CANCELLATION POLICY-


In the event you have to cancel your registration, a full event credit will be provided automatically via SmoothComp. The cancellation deadline is by April 12, 11-59 PM. After the deadline to edit registration, all registrations are considered final with no event credit available. Credits are issued when you log into your account and cancel your event registration. Coupon codes are viewable in the “My Account” area of SmoothComp. Competitors whose opponents no showed or withdrew from their division, leaving them without a match on event day, will receive a full coupon credit if there are no other appropriate divisions available.


BRACKETS AND SCHEDULE-


Friday Afternoon before the tournament, April 12, the event brackets and schedule will be released. You will be able to locate both on the event page brackets and schedule tab. At the tournament, there will be a flat screen TV where the event schedule is displayed. The referee at your screen will also make a courtesy call for you to come to the screen if you haven’t already presented yourself for the bracket. Please be at the screen on time for your matches. We ask that you make sure to be present in the venue at least 60 minutes prior to your division start time. Some matches end faster than others, so this may allow us to start some divisions sooner. You can also see when your matches are coming up by checking the tab on your mobile device during the competition. The schedule is tentative and may change based on the number of athletes registered.
