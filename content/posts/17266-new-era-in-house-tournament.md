## Description
Welcome to NEW ERA JIU JITSU ACADEMY’s first “In-House” tournament!


We hope our NEW ERA students will take advantage of this great opportunity to get a small peek at the competition side of Jiu Jitsu.


NEW ERA does NOT require any student to compete, this tournament is an option and in no way mandatory.


This event is for all NEW ERA students, with opportunities to compete in a submission only rule set. You can register for gi, nogi, and adults can choose to compete in an open-belt, open-weight absolute bracket.


This double elimination competition will be located at our academy, with children’s divisions starting at 9am.


Weigh-ins will be held on 5/31.


Children weigh-in 4-30pm-6pm


Adult weigh-in 11am-1pm, 6-30pm-7-30pm


Cost- $30.00 (early bird)


Cost 05/23-05/27- $40.00


Registration fee gets children both gi and nogi divisions, and gets adults gi, nogi and an option to enter the absolute division.


*With this being our first in-house tournament, some brackets will be merged with various ages, weights and belts. All safety precautions will be taken to ensure the best matches and highest amount of matches possible.


This will be a submission only rule set. (submission restrictions on registration page)
