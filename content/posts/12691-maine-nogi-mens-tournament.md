In the event theres is only one competitior or multiple smaller divisions we will potentially combine divisions with competitor approval to give all competitors more matches 


We have opened alot of divisions and due to our facility will only be running two matches at a time, we will close registration if we feel we have reached a number of competitors that would cause the tournament to not run efficiently
