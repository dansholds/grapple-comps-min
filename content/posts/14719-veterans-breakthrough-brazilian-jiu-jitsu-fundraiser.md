Who we are...


Veterans Breakthrough is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit charity organization founded in 2020 that unites the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu community with a honorable cause-  Empowering veterans in their journey's post service;  we do this through our various programs we have to offer.


For this 1st annual event we will be hosting a kids only tournament open to all.  Followed by a battle of the branches where a select few veterans from each branch will come together to compete and raise funds for our cause.  


Our goal is to keep entry cost lower and create a fun stress free tournament for kids....and parents.  All competitors will gain access to a their own fundraising page where they will be able to raise funds for our cause and for each $100 raised they will be put into a drawing to win free BJJ Gear.  The more you raise the higher your chances to win!!


Why Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu?


We recognize the multifaceted challenges veterans often face post-service, including physical injuries, mental health concerns, and the daunting task of reintegrating into civilian life. Through our programs, we've found that Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) serves as a powerful tool for aiding veterans on their path to recovery and well-being.


The Healing Power of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu


Physical Benefits


Jiu-Jitsu is more than a martial art; it's a discipline that focuses on leverage and technique rather than size or strength. This makes it an ideal choice for individuals with varying physical abilities. Through consistent practice, veterans experience-



Improved Fitness- BJJ training promotes cardiovascular health, strength, flexibility, and endurance. It aids in weight management and boosts overall physical wellness.


Pain Management- For veterans dealing with physical injuries or chronic pain, the controlled and gradual movements in BJJ help manage discomfort and enhance mobility. 



Mental Health Support


Beyond the physical aspects, Jiu-Jitsu profoundly impacts mental health-



Stress Reduction- Engaging in BJJ offers an outlet for stress relief. The focus required during training helps veterans divert their attention from intrusive thoughts or stressors, promoting mental relaxation.


Building Resilience- BJJ instills resilience by challenging individuals in a controlled environment. The process of learning, failing, and persisting fosters mental fortitude—a crucial skill in overcoming life's hurdles.



Community and Camaraderie


Our BJJ programs foster a sense of belonging and camaraderie among veterans. The training environment encourages teamwork, mutual support, and a shared goal of self-improvement. Veterans often find solace in the community aspect, forging bonds with peers who understand and empathize with their experiences.


If you’ve never heard of our tournaments, they are one-of-a-kind, to say the least. Instead of just paying to compete, tournament competitors can compete for FREE by fundraising on behalf of Tap Cancer Out and our beneficiaries. Plus, the more you fundraise, the more prizes you can earn from our generous sponsors. This is on top of taking part in an incredibly well-organized and positive event.
