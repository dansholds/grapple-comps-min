## Description
BJJ247 is thrilled to extend an invitation to Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu enthusiasts for the highly anticipated Northwest Open 2024. The event will take place on Sunday 24th November at the Tower Ballroom Blackpool bringing together some of the UK’s most accomplished and promising grapplers for an exhilarating day of competition.
  

    Our venue boasts state-of-the-art facilities, including Dollamur Flexi-Connect Mats, a 40-inch scoreboard, and a live results system. Furthermore, our changing division policy allows participants to make modifications to their registration until the week of the bracket release. In exceptional cases where competitors are alone in their division, we may merge them with another fair division, provided one is available.
  

    The brackets and schedule will be released at least 48 hours prior to the tournament. Attendees can view these on the event page under the brackets and schedule tab, as well as via their mobile devices during the competition.  However, we implore participants to arrive at least 60 minutes before their division start time to ensure timely commencement.
  

    Weigh-ins will occur on the day of the event, at least 30 minutes before the match start time in uniform. Failure to make weight for a division will result in disqualification. Competitors only need to weigh-in once if participating in several divisions.
  

    All podium finishers will receive bespoke gold, silver, or bronze medals, and we will take podium photos during the post-week of events. Attendees can rest assured knowing a trained and professional medic will be on-site, and warm-up areas will be designated away from the competition arena.
  

    Attendees will have the opportunity to purchase discounted products from our on-site sponsors, including Wolf Whiskey, Acai, and Raine. Additionally, hot food and fresh Acai and sorbet will be available at the event.
  

    We encourage participants to review the competitor lists, which will be available throughout the registration process on the event page. Team standings, points, and medal counts will be live updated on the results tab of the event page. Similarly, division brackets, along with their final placements, will be readily available.
  

    Join us for an unforgettable experience, featuring top-tier talent, cutting-edge facilities, and a world-class atmosphere.
