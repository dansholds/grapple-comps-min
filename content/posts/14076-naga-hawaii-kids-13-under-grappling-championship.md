VENUE SPECIFIC RULES


IMPORTANT CLEAR BAG POLICIES FOR RADFORD-


All NAGA Competitors, Coaches and Spectators-


Radford High School is requiring that any and all items being brought into the gym be in a clear bag to show what is being transported into the gym.  The high school is NOT mandating any size or exact type of clear bag...could be a clear rubbish bag...as long as it is accessible to be able to see at the checkpoint.  If you are a competitor/coach or spectator flying in from another island and have luggage, the high school has offered to store your luggage in a secure closet until you need to leave the event.


No vehicles will be allowed to park overnight at the school. Vehicles left overnight will be towed by a contractor who will be watching the lots after hours.


No tents are allowed.


No tailgating is allowed.


No eating or drinking (other than water) is allowed in the gym. Only water is allowed in the gym.


Parking is $5, no re-entry. If you leave and return, you will have to pay the $5 fee again.
