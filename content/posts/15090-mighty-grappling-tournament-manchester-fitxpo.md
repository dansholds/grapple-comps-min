ARRIVAL TIME


You only have to be at the event 1 hour before you fight to sign in, warmed up and weighed in.  You don't have to be there all day, however you are welcome to arrive early and stay as long as you would like. Your tickets will guarantee you access to both days so be sure to get them early to avoid disappointment!


FIGHT TIMES


We will only know fight times once registration has closed and brackets have been created. We estimate to have this information on the 17th of May but will keep everyone update in our social media.


MERGES


We will be looking at the competitor list on 15th of May and will start to make any necessary merges.  Ideally there should be at least 4 in a category in case someone does not show up, so fights can still go ahead. You also have the opportunity to merge/move yourself into another category on Check Day.
