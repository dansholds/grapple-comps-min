Come join in the action as NEWBREED makes it's return to Virginia for the Richmond Spring Championship! Held at the Richmond Raceway on May 4th, this is one tournament you won't want to miss
this spring.


With divisions for every age group and skill level, there's a place for
you at NEWBREED. Whether you're a complete novice or a seasoned competitor, you'll have the opportunity to showcase your skills
and compete against other talented opponents.


Step onto the podium and claim your custom medal as one of the top three
athletes in your division. These medals not only symbolize victory but
also your dedication and hard work. This is your chance to prove that
success is earned, not given.


More experienced athletes will be challenged in our advanced divisions.
First-place winners in any advanced division will be awarded the
prestigious NJJF Championship Belt, representing their dominance on the
mat.


Ready for the ultimate challenge? The nogi absolute division is where
the
real action will take place. Only the best of the best will compete for
the title of Absolute Champion, regardless of weight class.


But it's not just about individual performances. At the end of the tournament team points will be
calculated to determine the top three teams in the youth and adult
categories, as well as the overall team champion. These seven teams will
receive an award banner to display in their academy, and the first-place
winning teams will take home a NJJF custom trophy.


So rally the team and get prepared to battle it out for the number one spot this spring! We'll see you on the mat!
