## Description
In 2024 The Warriors Return.


“We chose whether to be warriors or to be ordinary."


It's been 3 years since our last full sized Competition at Harrow Leisure Centre, but this is the year the LWC returns, for a very Special 5th Edition. The pioneers of independent prize giving tournaments, our 2024 event will have everything you'd expect from an LWC competition, generous cash prizes, tickets to the IBJJF Europeans up for grabs, championship belts, envy inducing medals, sackfulls of merch, top names, BJJ shopping, delicious Acai, top quality referees and professional organisation.

As always there's Important Info and T&C's.


+ Registration may close earlier than the date advertised as entry will close once the event is at full capacity.


+ The organiser reserves the right to refuse admission to any athlete or spectator.


+ Prizes are given at the discretion of the organizer and only if the minimum number of athletes are registered in the division to fight. Any prize may be withdrawn or altered without notice. All prizes will be awarded solely to the winning competitor and are not transferable. No cash substitutes will be offered for non cash prizes. 


+ Registration fees are non refundable and non transferrable. Please do not contact us asking to transfer your registration to a team mate.


+ The Organisers will not make any changes to registrations.  If you are alone in your bracket you have the option to move yourself into a higher weight division (or lower age division if master) if you so wish, or withdraw your name from the tournament before the deadline for changes ends. Once the deadline has passed, you will be offered a default medal and the chance to compete in the absolute division, and no refunds will be offered. It is the competitors responsibility to make changes to their own registration. Information on how these changes can be made can be found on the Smoothcomp Knowledge base.


+ There will be one adult absolute division per belt ranking.


+ Unfortunately we are unable to offer absolute divisions for  juveniles for safety reasons. 


+ Wherever we are able to offer prizes for female divisions, the prizes will always be equal to the equivalent male division. 


+ Minimum 8 competitors required in Adult Absolute divisions.
