    To ensure we can host full, competitive brackets, there may be a chance that categories are merged together. Please prepare for the possibility of fighting in a category above or below your usual weight or age class.
  

    We will be using a simplified IBJJF rule set, with no advantages or penalties in play. In the event of a draw, the winner will be determined via "golden score" overtime, in which the first to score points (or submit their opponent) will win. Minor/unintentional fouls (reaping etc.) will result in 1 warning, 2 warnings will mean a DQ. Major fouls (slamming from closed guard etc) will result in immediate DQ.
  

    On the day of the competition, please keep an eye on your smoothcomp account and refresh the page regularly, as timescales are live and may change without warning. 
  

    Sainsbury's & Starbucks within walking distance, healthy refreshments available on-site.
