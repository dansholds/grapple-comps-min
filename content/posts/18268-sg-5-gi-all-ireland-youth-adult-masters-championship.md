Competition Rules modifications and Format-


    Our referees have two objectives-
  

    1. Ensure all competitors are safe; and
  

    2. Ensure the correct athlete wins.
  

    We may make decisions that are viewed as unfair or inaccurate but this is only done in the spirit of protecting an athlete and thus we do not see it as an error. 
  

    The Solid Ground All Ireland Youth Championship adheres to the rules and regulations set forth by the International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation (IBJJF), with necessary modifications to prioritise the safety and fairness of our young participants.
  

    Detailed explanations of the rules will be provided to all competitors before their matches commence - please attend the rules meeting.
  

    We have made one main adjustment to the rules and that is jumping guard will be banned across the board for all competitors due to the mixing of experience. 
  

    By following these rules, athletes can ensure a safe and fair competition environment for themselves and their opponents.
  

    Advantages will only be included for juveniles matches. 
  

Divisions - Weight, age and belts-


Pooling method-


    Pooling of competitors will be organized based on factors such as weight and age, aiming to create balanced matchups as closely as possible. While we understand that skill levels can vary, particularly due to differences in belt ranks, pooling based on weight and age remains the default method across multiple grappling sports.
  

    By pooling competitors in this manner, we aim to create an environment that promotes healthy competition, growth, and development for all participants. Our primary focus is to provide an opportunity for young athletes to showcase their skills, gain valuable experience, and foster a sense of camaraderie within the Jiu-Jitsu community.

Spectators, Coaches, and Athlete Areas-


    We welcome spectators, coaches, and athletes to the Solid Ground All Ireland Youth Championship. To ensure a well-organised and enjoyable experience for everyone involved, designated areas will be assigned to each group. Spectators can cheer on their favorite competitors from the designated spectator areas, while coaches will have dedicated spaces to support and guide their athletes. Athletes will have designated warm-up areas and competition mats to prepare and compete to the best of their abilities.
  

    We will have 1 chair on each side of every score table, 1 for each coach of the competitor on the mat. The only other people allowed within the barricades during the tournament are the competitors on the mat having their match and the competitors due to compete next.
  

Coach Etiquette for Competition-


    In the spirit of fostering a supportive and respectful environment, we kindly remind all coaches of the importance of maintaining appropriate conduct and etiquette throughout the competition. As two young competitors engage in their matches, it is crucial that coaches demonstrate sportsmanship and ensure that celebrations are focused solely on the accomplishments of their own athletes.
  

    Coaches play a pivotal role in guiding and supporting their students, and it is imperative that they exercise restraint and sensitivity in their actions at the mat side. This includes refraining from excessive celebrations, loud cheering, or displays of intensity that may overshadow the experience of the young participants. Instead, coaches are encouraged to show respect for the efforts of all competitors and exhibit positive reinforcement towards their own athletes.
  

    By adhering to these guidelines, coaches contribute to a positive and encouraging atmosphere, where the focus remains on the growth and development of the young practitioners. Let us create an environment that highlights the achievements of all participants and cultivates a sense of camaraderie among coaches and athletes alike.
  

    Failure to co-operate with the mat etiquette will follow a 3 strike policy (3 strikes and you are out). Mat side officials, event organisers and referees may issue warnings. Continued unsportsmanlike behaviour will result in being removed from the competition hall. 
  

Child Safety and Referee Disputes-


    At the Solid Ground All Ireland Youth Championship, the safety and well-being of our young participants are of paramount importance. Our referees are trained to prioritize the safety of the children above all else. In cases where a referee makes a stoppage due to safety concerns, any disputes regarding these stoppages will be voided.
  

    We understand that disputes may arise regarding referee calls, and we encourage participants and coaches to address any concerns in a respectful manner. If there is a disagreement with a referee's decision, it is essential to first approach the referee at the end of the match to discuss the matter and seek clarification.
  

    If, after discussing the issue with the referee, there is still disagreement and the disputing party has match footage available, they may request for the matter to be brought to the attention of the head referee. The head referee will then review the match footage and, if necessary, may consider the possibility of replaying the match to ensure fairness and accuracy in the final outcome.
  

    By providing a clear process for addressing referee disputes, we aim to maintain a fair and respectful environment for all participants. We prioritise the safety and integrity of the competition, while also striving to uphold transparency and sportsmanship throughout the event.
  

    Any disputes made in an unprofessional manner does not need to be addressed and may result in a warning from officials.
