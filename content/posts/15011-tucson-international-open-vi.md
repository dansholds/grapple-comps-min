The support of the transgender community is an important aspect of fostering inclusivity and equality. It is crucial to recognize and respect each individual's gender identity and provide them with the necessary resources and support they need to live authentically. However, when it comes to competitive sports ensuring fairness and maintaining a level playing is also essential. Therefore, our organization has implemented policies that require transgender individuals to compete in the gender division assigned at birth. These policies aim to strike a balance between inclusivity and maintaining fair competition, acknowledging the potential physiological advantages that may exist. It is important to approach this issue with sensitivity, openness, and ongoing dialogue to ensure that all individuals, regardless of their gender identity, have equal opportunities to participate in sports while upholding the principles of fair competition.
