## Description
NGA BRACKET CHALLENGE FOR $1,000.00+


*Each bracket has unlimited competitor entries; however, it must have a minimum of 10 competitors to proceed. The first 10 competitors are guaranteed to fight for a cash prize of $1,000. For every additional competitor who registers after the initial 10, an additional $75 out of the $100 entry shall be added to the cash prize pot. 


For example, if there are 36 entries in the male adult bracket (-160 lbs), the cash prize payout will be $2,950.00 ($1000 for initial 10, $1,950 for 11-36 competitors (26 x $75 = $1,950)). The same is true for all the other brackets.

REFUNDS- Refunds shall be granted once communication has been established with NGA management via written email regarding why the competitor is dropping out prior to the tournament. The reason for the email is to ensure we can reach out to anyone else or see if your spot can be filled. A 100% refund shall be granted if the bracket does not meet the minimum of 10 competitors. No other refunds shall be refunded the day before, the day of, and or any day after the event for any reason given.

*Weight loss is encouraged as long as it is done healthily and responsibly. Any weight loss larger than 7lbs., dependent on body fat percentage, is not encouraged and is at the sole risk of the competitor(s), the competitor's coach(s), and the competitor’s family and friends. Everyone involved should make sure all competitors are losing weight healthily and responsibly. Any health, medical, or death-related incidents shall not be at the fault of NGA or its third parties involved with the Bracket Challenge.


COMPETITOR ATTIRE- No-Gi- Rash guard top with rash guard short bottoms or long rash guard bottoms or plain shorts with no pockets. (No holes, wear and tear of long threads attached to any piece of clothing)


BRACKET RULES- Single elimination brackets. A male or female competitor can enter more than one bracket within their gender as long as they make weight. 


BRACKET SEEDING- Smoothcomp will randomly place everyone once brackets are created. If returning winners (1st & 2nd winners) decide to return, they will be seeded according to overall record and head-to-head matches.


MATCH RULES- Sub-only matches with 3-Referees (Ref(s)) decision at the end of the match for which color competitor they feel won. The majority decision is final from 3 refs.


TIME LIMIT- Adults- 6-minute matches; at the 3-minute mark, refs will raise the color they are favoring to win.


SUBMISSIONS ALLOWED- Referees during the 6-minute sub-only rounds ensure no competitor uses illegal moves such as fishhooks, punches, slaps, slamming, pulling hair, eye gouging, groin grabs or strikes, etc. All BJJ submissions and moves are granted except those mentioned under illegal moves.


·       Competitors violating any illegal moves or submissions mentioned will result in a warning, penalty, and/or disqualification (DQ). The chart below shows illegal moves or submissions not granted in the bracket challenge.
