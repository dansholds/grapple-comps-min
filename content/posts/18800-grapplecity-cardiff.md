    Format is round robin which gives competitors maximum experience for their money!

    Pricing is best in the industry among round robin format tournaments. The most important thing for competitors is to receive maximum experience with each competition.
  

    That's why our slogan is- “Pay less, compete more!” 
  

    Changing divisions- After late registration closes, all competitors (or coaches, parents) have until 5PM the following day to make any changes. These changes can be made by logging in & modifying your details. After this change deadline, it will no longer be available to access & change. Competitors who are on their own in a division can change to move up a division or cancel their registration for a full credit.

    for more.
  

    Refund policy- Refunds are available up until the end of the early bird date via logging into your smoothcomp a/c. From the normal reg deadline until the tournament itself, only full credits for future tournaments will be issued. If your opponent doesn't show up on the day you will receive a full coupon credit.
  

    Brackets & Schedule- Event brackets will be released 2 days prior to the tournament. You can see when your match is on by monitoring your smoothcomp page. TV screens in the venue on the day will also show this.
  

    On the day registration- Prepare your smoothcomp ID by visiting smoothcomp.com/id & having QR code ready to scan at the barcode scanners at the front of house.
  

    Weigh Ins- Visit the weigh in desk immediately once you pass registration desk. You only need to weigh in once (without Gi on) for both divisions.
  

    Medals- We recently changed our medal design & we now have truly beautiful medals ready to put around our podium finishers necks! We can’t wait for you to see them.
