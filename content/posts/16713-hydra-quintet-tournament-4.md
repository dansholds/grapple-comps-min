## Description
Quintet Classic Rules-



Each match will have two teams of five players face each other in a ‘winner stays on’ or Quintet match.




Each round can only be won via submission that gains a point for your team and eliminates the submitted player. 




If a round ends without a submission, both players will be eliminated.




If a player is injured or cannot continue, it counts as a point for their opponent. A team can continue competing with less than 5 players.




If a player is disqualified, it counts as a point towards their opponent.




The match ends when all players of a team have been eliminated.




If a match ends in a draw, the last player of each team competes in an EBI overtime round to determine the winner.




If EBI overtime ends in a draw, the team with the least amount of stalling calls is the winner.



Further information about the rules and guidelines can be found in the next page.


Quintet Rivals Rules-


We're excited to announce our new mixed gender team battle format pitting each competitor against a matching rival. Here is the team composition you must have for the team.



Each match will have two teams of five players face each other in a series of one versus one rounds.


A player may only compete against another player of the same weight and gender category.


At the start of each match, a coin flip determines which team gets to choose the player order. This also determines the players who may do the overtime round in the event of a tie. The team who loses the coin flip determines the starting position of the overtime round.


Each round can only be won via submission which then scores a point for your team. 


If a player cannot compete at the start of their round, it counts as a point for their opponent.




If a player is disqualified, it counts as a point towards their opponent.


Points are counted at the end of the round and the team with the most points wins.




If a match ends in a draw, the last player of each team competes in an EBI overtime round to determine the winner.




If EBI overtime ends in a draw, the team with the least amount of stalling calls is the winner.
