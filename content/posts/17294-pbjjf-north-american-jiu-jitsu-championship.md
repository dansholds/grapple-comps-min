DOUBLE ELIMINATION FORMAT-


The basic concept of double elimination is similar to single elimination, in which there are rounds, and the winners advance in the brackets. The difference is that when the athlete loses a fight, he goes to another bracket which he will have the opportunity to keep competing for the 3rd place.


In this system, the athlete who wins all fights receives the gold medal, the competitor who loses in the final receives the silver and the winner of the bracket of the athletes who suffered a defeat receives the bronze medal.
