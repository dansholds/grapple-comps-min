NAGA CELEBRATES 30 YEARS OF GRAPPLING EXCELLENCE!


    The North American Grappling Association (NAGA) is excited to return to London, England, where grapplers of all skill levels and ages can showcase their talents and compete to win the best awards in grappling. As the world's largest mixed grappling organization, NAGA offers divisions for Gi and No-Gi competitors, providing a platform for athletes to challenge themselves in a professional and well-organized event. Whether you're a seasoned competitor or a first-time participant, NAGA tournaments promise a memorable experience. 
  

  NEW FOR 2025-


  2 MATCH BRACKETS FOR ALL COMPETITORS



        2-Person Divisions- Best 2-out-of-3 
      

        3-Person Divisions- Round Robin
      

        4-Person + Divisions-  4 or more competitors will now have a 3rd place bracket for those who lose a match enabling them to compete again at no extra cost
      


    These new bracket types will make sure each competitor has a chance at two matches per division (barring injury, opponent withdrawal, etc.) so they can gain that valuable experience on the mats.
