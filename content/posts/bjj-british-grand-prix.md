    <li>BJJ BRITISH OPEN aims to accommodate as many athletes as possible, but there's a limit to ensure quality.</li>
    <li>Registration changes can be made via Smoothcomp account until midnight on 16th October 23:59.</li>
    <li>Athletes must agree to be moved if division has less than 3 competitors unless specified in "payment information."</li>
    <li>IBJJF modified rule set with 1 point for advantages and penalties, 5-minute matches from Juvenile upwards, and last to score wins.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Arrive at least 60 minutes before your bracket schedule.</li>
    <li>Weigh in around 45 minutes before your division, remain in the bullpen until called to the mat.</li>
    <li>Bring valid identification (driver’s license, passport, or IBJJF ID).</li>
    <li>Kids require BIRTH CERTIFICATE, PASSPORT, or IBJJF ID.</li>

    <li>Brackets and schedule available 48 hours prior to the tournament.</li>
    <li>Report to weigh-in area 45 minutes before your match; no-show after 3 PA System calls leads to disqualification.</li>
