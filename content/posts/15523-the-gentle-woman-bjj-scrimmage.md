## Description
Competing for the very first time in your BJJ journey can be intimidating, so why not start with a scrimmage? The Gentle Woman BJJ Scrimmage is for ladies ages 12 years old and up in the Maryland area. This is a time for you to test out a new skill, try your favorite takedown in real-time, work your best (or worst) submission, and make connections with women in the Jiu-Jitsu community! We have no winners, no losers and weight cutting is highly discouraged and unnecessary. Join us on April 27th, 2024 in Annapolis, MD for our first Ladies Only Scrimmage. Yes, you must be at least 12 to register! Yes, you must be a female! Yes, you must want to have fun and meet new ladies in the DMV area! I'll see you on the mats!
