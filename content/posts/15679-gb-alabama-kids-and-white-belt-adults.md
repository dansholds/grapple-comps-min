## Description
Welcome!


Gracie Barra Alabama is hosting this event for GB members only. Our focus is to give our students the exposure of a friendly atmosphere competition to encourage them to enter in bigger events.Â 


Our plan is to host four events this year.


GB Pelham March 2nd.


GB Pelham June 8th.


GB Pelham August 24th


GB Pelham November 9th


With the funds of these events, we will use 100% of it to sponsor some competitors to participate at IBJJF events in 2024-2025.


There is the possibility that some divisions could be combined to make sure our competitors will get at least two matches. We are also doing double elimination brackets.


For additional questions, contact your professors and coaches.
