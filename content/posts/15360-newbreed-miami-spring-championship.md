## Description
Mark your calendars for April 13th as NJJF returns to Miami to bring you the Miami Spring Championship!


Whether you're a seasoned Jiu-Jitsu practitioner or just starting your
journey, our tournament welcomes competitors of all ages and skill
levels. With both gi and nogi divisions offered, this is your chance to step
onto the mat and test your skills.


Stand tall on the podium with custom medals awarded to the top three
athletes in each division, symbolizing your dedication and achievement.
First-place winners in any advanced division will be honored with the
prestigious NJJF Championship Belt, a true mark of excellence.


Ready for the ultimate challenge? Sign up for our nogi absolute
division, where technique and strategy reign supreme. Here the best
athletes in the region go head to head regardless of weight class. Only
one will walk away victorious!


Jiu-Jitsu is about more than individual success; and at NEWBREED
teamwork is aptly rewarded. Team points are calculated to determine the
top three teams in both youth and adult categories as well as the
overall champion. All seven teams receive an award banner to hang
proudly in their academy. First-place teams also take home a custom NJJF
trophy, a symbol of their collective excellence.


So rally the team and get ready to put your skills to the test at the Miami Spring Championship on April 13th. We'll see you on the mats!
