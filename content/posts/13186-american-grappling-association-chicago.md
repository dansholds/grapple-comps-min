Location- Oak Lawn Pavilion 9401 Oak Park Ave, Oak Lawn, IL 60453


Doors Open @ 7-30am | Event Starts @ 9am


FORMAT and PROTOCOL- American Grappling Association tournaments follow a Round Robin Pool format meaning that all adult competitors get 4 matches for signing up for a division that fills up to 5 competitors. That means if you compete in both Gi and NoGi, you could get 8 plus fights. This allows you to compete against so many different people, giving you the experience you deserve! All American Grappling Association matches follow a points structure but without advantages! We are also very legal submission friendly!
