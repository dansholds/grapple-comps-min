You can make these changes by logging into your account and modifying your registration details. At this deadline, registrations become finalized, and there will be no further changes allowed.

Bracket Combinations-


After the 3 P.M. deadline on Thursday to edit registration info, competitors who do not have anyone in their division group will be combined into another appropriate division. All athletes who remain alone in their divisions once brackets are finalized at 8 P.M. Thursday have no available combinations available to them, and therefore there are no matches available for that competitor. They will receive a full coupon credit for entry to any future Submission Challenge event.
