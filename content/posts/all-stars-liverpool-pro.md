<p><strong>LIVERPOOL PRO COACH PASSES 📣</strong></p>
<p>❗️Coach pass system❗️</p>
<p>Only Brown or Black Belts who actively coach at or own an academy will be eligible for a coach pass at our events.</p>
<p>This is to ease the number of people in the coaches/athlete area. Security check points will be in place to ensure those entering the area have a coach pass - we request that you be respectful to staff always.</p>
<p>Other coaches will still be able to coach athletes with ease from the outside of the mats - a simple chain link barrier separates the crowd from the mat areas.</p>
<p>To obtain a coach pass for the Liverpool Pro event, please send the following information to info@allstarsbjj.co.uk with the subject line ‘Coach Pass Request’:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Name</li>
  <li>Team Name</li>
  <li>Belt / Rank</li>
  <li>Position within academy</li>
  <li>ID style picture</li>
</ul>
<p>The deadline (SUNDAY 26 July) - any requests made after this date will not be actioned.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>The All Stars BJJ team</p>
