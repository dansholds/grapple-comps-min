We are introducing a 'Ghost Bracket'. This is an invisible category which anyone from white to brown belt can sign up for and we will only make it visible to you on the day. We message/email you with the rough time that it will go ahead on the day and you will only find out who you will be going against at the time the bracket starts. It will be a mixed category so you will go with mixed age, weight and belt and a choice if you go Gi or No Gi, so you could choose Gi and go against an opponent with NoGi . This will be using the smoothcomp technology so no changes can be made on the day. Over 18's only! Prizes: All money made from this bracket will be divided between:


1st place 50%


2nd place 30% 


3rd place 20%.
