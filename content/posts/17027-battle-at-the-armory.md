SPECTATORS


- There will be no charge for spectators.


- Spectators are required to show good conduct at all times and be respectful of the referees, the athletes and other spectators. Any spectator who violates this general rule will be asked to leave immediately.


GENERAL RULES (SEE RULES TAB FOR MORE INFO)


 - Competitors will weigh in at the door (must be before 1 hour of matches). The Gi will not be required to weigh in unless the competitor is only competing in the Gi Division. Competitors will only be required to weigh in once.


- No unsportsmanlike conduct will be allowed. NOTE- Referees, at their own discretion, may disqualify and or eject any competitor or coach for unsportsmanlike conduct.


- In divisions ages 4 to 15 and adult white belt, the referee has the right to call the match if he or she believes the submission or position may cause serious injury.


- No visible body jewelry will be allowed. - The competitor and his or her uniform must be clean. - No infectious skin diseases or open wounds will be permitted.


- Fingernails and toenails must be clipped. - To the best of our abilities, we will be dividing adults and kids' divisions by weight, age, and experience level, but we reserve the right to combine and expand divisions as we see fit.


Breaking of these rules is grounds for immediate disqualification.  Referees are the final word on any call related to breaking the rules.  They are the closest ones to the action.  All of our referees have a well-documented tenure in the sport of Jiu Jitsu and are there not just to insure a fair match, but a safe one.
