- Submission is the way to win. When either competitor taps the match is over.


- If there is no submission then it goes to EBI overtime rules.


- Warnings shall be given for stalling during the match by the referee.


EBI Rules


- EBI Overtime (1 round minimum/3 rounds maximum)If there is no submission after the regulation time limit, each competitor will have the chance to try to submit their opponent as fast as they can, while the other has a chance to escape. There will be a coin toss to determine which competitor will choose if they are starting on offense or defense.


 - The competitor on offense gets to choose if they want to start in back control or armbar. Offense options-


• Back control with a seatbelt grip (grip must be in the middle of the opponent’s chest). The defensive competitor may only secure his grips in a “pull up” fashion on the offensive competitor’s arms, but cannot sneak his or her hands inside the offensive competitor’s grips. Competitor on defense must sit up with perfect posture and may not lean forward or sideways until the referee officially starts the OT round.  


• Armbar with one arm fully threaded in and holding the armbar, and the other hand on the mat. Competitors must be lined up perpendicularly with the competitor on defense flat on his back with his feet planted flat on the floor. The defensive competitor can only choose a figure four (aka “rear naked choke grip”) defense, or a gable grip (aka “palm to palm grip”). No other grips allowed at the start of spider web OT.


- If there is a submission in the top of the round, the competitor who was submitted needs to secure a submission faster than he or she was submitted.


- If there is a submission in the bottom of the round, the competitor who achieved the submission wins the match (since the other competitor was unable to submit their opponent in the top of the round).


Always keep escaping, even if you think you’re clear, keep escaping until the referee calls time. If competitor on defense thinks he’s out and makes gestures to the referee to stop the action, that means the escape is NOT complete. Keep escaping keep moving until the referee is clear that an escape has been achieved.
