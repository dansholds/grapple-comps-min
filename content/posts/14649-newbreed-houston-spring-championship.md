Get ready to put your jiu jitsu to the test at the Houston Spring Championship! Join us at The Zone on March 16th for one of the most exciting tournaments of the season.


No matter your age or skill level, there's division for you at this tournament. And with custom medals awarded to the top three athletes in each division, you'll have the chance to showcase your skills and earn recognition for your hard work.


If you're a more experienced athlete, you'll be aiming for the prized NJJF Championship Belt, which will be awarded to the first place winners of any advanced division.


For those seeking the toughest challenge, the nogi absolute division will be a true battleground where only the best of the best will emerge victorious.


But it's not just about individual glory. At the end of the tournament team points will be calculated to determine the top three teams in the youth and adult categories, as well as the one overall team champion. All seven teams will receive an award banner to display in their academy, and the first-place winning teams will take home a custom trophy.


This is your chance to take your game to the next level this spring! So get in the gym and get ready to earn your place on the NJJF podium. We'll see you on the mat!
