## Description
British Wrestling -Grappling World Championship GBR Selection.


    Subject to eligibility *
  

  All competitors must be a member of the British Wrestling Association on the day of the competition. Either a day membership or Full membership is acceptable.


    In a landmark partnership that signifies a new era for British wrestling, BJJ247, one of the UK's premier Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and grappling organizations, has joined forces with British Wrestling to host this qualifying event in Manchester. 
  

    This pivotal event will determine the athletes who will represent Great Britain at the prestigious United World Wrestling (UWW) Grappling Championships during 2025. This collaboration between BJJ247 and British wrestling marks a significant milestone in the history of grappling sports within the UK. By combining resources and expertise, the two entities aim to elevate the standard of British grappling and provide a platform for the nation's best talents to shine on the world stage. The qualifying event, set to take place in Manchester, is not just another tournament; it's a gateway for British grapplers to the global arena. 
  

    The competition will adhere to UWW's grappling rules, which blend techniques from various disciplines, including Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, wrestling, judo, and sambo, making it a comprehensive test of a grappler's skill set. Athletes will compete in various weight categories, with the winners earning the honour to don the Great Britain jersey at the UWW Grappling Championships during 2025.
  

    This is an opportunity of a lifetime for British grapplers to showcase their skills against the world's best and to contribute to the legacy of British wrestling and grappling on the international stage. 
  

    The decision to host the qualifying event in Manchester was strategic, considering the city's rich sporting heritage and its vibrant grappling community. Manchester's world-class facilities and its accessibility for athletes from across the UK make it the perfect location for such a pivotal event. 
  

    BJJ247's involvement brings a level of expertise and organization that is unparalleled in the British grappling scene. Known for hosting some of the most well-run and competitive grappling tournaments in the country, BJJ247's experience in managing events of this scale ensures that the qualifying event will be a landmark occasion for all involved. 
  

    We understand the financial burden that athletes face when representing their country on the international stage. Historically, athletes who qualified for the British wrestling/ grappling Championships had to self-fund their trip, which often proved to be a significant barrier for many talented individuals. 
  

    In an effort to alleviate this burden and ensure that as many qualified athletes as possible have the opportunity to compete without financial constraints, we have decided to fund a portion of the costs with a percentage of the entry fee charged for the upcoming World Grappling Championship qualifying. This initiative aims to support our athletes and promote inclusivity within the sport, hopefully allowing everyone to showcase their skills and represent the United Kingdom proudly on the global stage by only having to raise the entry fee of the qualifying competition.
  

  ALL DIVISION WINNERS QUALIFY TO REPRESENT THE GBR TEAM AT THE 2025 UWW CHAMPIONSHIPS.


    Subject to Eligibility - Must hold a British Passport to qualify for selection.
