## Description
KCL BJJ X LONDON GRAPPLE INTERVARSITY TOURNAMENT: 2 MARCH 2024


Welcome to KCL BJJ's third Intervarsity Tournament for the academic year 2023/24! We are extremely excited to be back and working in collaboration with London Grapple, our head gym, yet again to produce another successful event!


LOCATION: London Grapple, 17 Ffinch St, London SE8 5QA


EVENT START: 2PM TO 7PM+


RULES: Modified IBJJF No-Gi Rules



No advantages



FORMAT


Single Elimination (subject to change)


DIVISIONS (GRAPPLING EXPERIENCE): 



0 MONTHS to 6 MONTHS (BEGINNER)*


6 MONTHS to 2 YEARS (ADVANCED BEGINNER)



*The BEGINNER division is strictly for competitors who have begun grappling THIS academic term, meaning from August/Sept 2023 onwards.


The goal for this division is for people who have just begun their grappling journey and want to join their first competition knowing they will not be going against significantly more experienced competitors. We will not tolerate sandbagging of any kind in this division as it is meant for beginners to have a fun, competitive experience. 


The 6 months to 2 years division is for experienced "white belts" who have substantial grappling experience. Thus, blue belts are not allowed to register for this division as well as grapplers who have been training for over 2 years.


DISCLAIMER: Any competitor suspected of being significantly outside of the skill level of any bracket on competition day may be suject to disqualification. Full discretion to do so lies with KCL BJJ. We may offer a refund depending on the circumstances.


All entrants will be vetted beforehand to make sure they are complying with the division guidelines.

Male



<64


64 > 70


70 > 76


76 > 82


>82



Female



<55


≥55



Weigh-ins will take place at 1PM before the matches begin.


DISCLAIMER: Competitors may be subject to changes in weight classes/divisions if there are too few or too many entrants in a division. Divisions will be locked 2 days before the event. We are happy to refund anyone who is unsatisfied with any changes made to their bracket before this date.


PRIZES


In addition to the usual medals given out, gold medalists of each division will take home a London Grapple rashguard (worth £40).


REGISTRATION


As the name implies, registration is limited to competitors who are attending a University BJJ Club (e.g. KCLBJJ, UCLBJJ, LSEBJJ, SOASBJJ) or entrants who are currently studying at university. However, if nearing the competition we need to fill up divisions we will be opening up registration to anyone.


If you are from a university outside of London, please feel free to register as well.


If you are attending university but attend an external gym please drop us a message on our socials, we would definitely be willing to make an exception.
