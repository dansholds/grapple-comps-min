## Description
This is a SUB ONLY comp under the IBJJF ruleset. If there is no sub before time runs out the ref will decide who wins the match. So to avoid disappointment it's strongly suggested you keep it out of the hands of the ref. This event is open to all belts, featuring adult & masters divisions. We will have professional videographers and photographer(s) at this event.
