  Level Up Your Takedown Game


    After the success of Take-Me-Down, we are setting up a new league of combat grappling sport for the enjoyment of wrestlers and takedown enthusiasts.
  

    If you're eager to refine your takedown techniques and test your skills in a focused setting, this is your chance. Join us in this exhilarating division, where you'll face off against opponents in your weight class and a safe ruleset detailed below.
  

    Don't miss this opportunity to push your limits and elevate your game. Sign up now and embark on a thrilling journey of competition and growth!
  

  Rules & Format


    Gladiator is a direct elimination tournament with a bronze fight.
  

    Each round lasts for 4 minutes, with the clock stopping after a successful takedown, then restarting from the center.
  

    A point is awarded for each takedown, followed by 3 seconds of ground control.
  

    Ground control requires the competitor to maintain dominance over their opponent for a 3-second period.
  

    Escaping ground control is only achieved by returning to a standing position; transitioning to a turtle position, for example, does not count as an escape.
  

    The first competitor to accumulate 3 points wins the match, and once this occurs, the match concludes.
  

    In the event of a tie, the referee will determine the winner based on demonstrated skills and initiative throughout the match.
  

  DQ Maneuvers


    The following techniques cause an immediate DQ for the perpetrator- 
  


        Head or neck spiking, including suplexes
      

        Submission or submission attempt
      

        Striking
      

        Slamming
      


  Penalty Maneuvers


    The following techniques are punished with a penalty point. 3 penalty points cause a DQ.
  


        Disengaging to avoid action
      

        Leaving the combat area to avoid a takedown
      


  Rules Summary

Description


Round Duration
Each round lasts for 4 minutes, with the clock stopping after a successful takedown, then restarting from the center.


Scoring
A point is awarded for each takedown, followed by 3 seconds of ground control.


Ground Control
Ground control requires the competitor to maintain dominance over their opponent for a 3-second period. A crackdown position in wrestling is a specific scenario that often occurs during a takedown attempt. Here is a definition- "A crackdown position in wrestling occurs when the offensive wrestler initiates a takedown, and both wrestlers end up on the mat side-by-side, with the defensive wrestler's hips and legs facing outward while the offensive wrestler controls the legs from behind or underneath. The wrestlers are generally in close contact, and the offensive wrestler is trying to advance to a more dominant position." Using this definition, we can further clarify that ground control requires their opponent to maintain dominance over their opponent for a 3 second period. Just ending up in crackdown or chest wrap is not enough to secure the point. Dominance must be achieved.


Escape Criteria
Escaping ground control is only achieved by returning back on your feet; transitioning to a turtle position does not count as an escape.


Winning the Match
The first competitor to accumulate 3 points wins the match, and once this occurs, the match concludes. If neither competitor accumulates 3 points, the competitor with the most points at the end of the 4-minute round wins the match.


Tie Breaker
In the event of a tie, the referee will determine the winner based on demonstrated skills and initiative throughout the match.


Disqualification (DQ) Maneuvers
The following techniques cause an immediate DQ for the perpetrator- Head or neck spiking, including suplexes, submission or submission attempt, striking, slamming.


Penalty Maneuvers
The following techniques are punished with a penalty point and 3 penalty points cause a DQ- disengaging to avoid action, leaving the combat area to avoid a takedown.

  Divisions


    Minimum age to participate in Gladiator is 9 years old.
  

    Groups are split by male and female. Up to 14 years old boys and girls might have to be merged, depending on the number of entries.
  

    The organisers will never merge by experience. If merging is needed, it can be by weigh or age one, when safe and fair to do so.
  

    Groups with 2 competitors will run.
  

  Experience level



        Experience level is not determined by jiu-jitsu belt rank. Some competitors may not have a jiu-jitsu background at all.
      



        The experience level is calculated based on the time spent in any form of stand-up takedown classes.
      



        Jiu-jitsu experience is not equivalent to wrestling experience. For example, a BJJ brown belt can still enter the Novice division in Gladiator if they have limited takedown experience.
      



        Stand-up classes include wrestling, stand-up BJJ takedown classes, judo, and similar disciplines.
      



        If someone has trained in stand-up takedown classes for less than a year, they are considered a Beginner.
      



        If your BJJ academy does not train takedowns, you are classified as a Beginner, regardless of your belt level.
      


  Uniform


    Athletes must follow the same guidelines as the No-Gi competitors-
  


        mandatory rashguard, board shorts, and optional spats and mouthguard.

        ear protectors
