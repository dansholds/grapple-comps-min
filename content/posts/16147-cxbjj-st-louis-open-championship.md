COMPETITOR LISTS- Competitor Lists will be LIVE throughout the registration process and can be viewed by checking out the registrations tab on the event page. We encourage everyone to login by the last day of registration and check their details along with the competitor lists, and not wait until the brackets are published and locked in to confirm such details.


CHANGING DIVISIONS- Before registration closes, all competitors (or coaches, parents) have until 5PM the day before to make any changes to their registrations. You can make these changes by logging into your account and modifying your registration details. After this change deadline, the registration will become locked in, and there will be no further changes allowed. Competitors who are alone in their division should choose to either self-move themselves up a division or cancel their registration for a full credit for next event.
