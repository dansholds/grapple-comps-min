Proving Grounds is Washington
State's longest running Submission Only BJJ/Nogi Grappling Tournament. We run
all brackets in a round robin format to give every competitor the most possible
matches (More matches/more learning). Great for adults and children. High level
competition and a guaranteed good time.


In an effort to stay true to our
mission of offering the best possible tournament please note-


1. We will
only be allowing competitors and coaches on the main gym floor. All others will
be asked to remain in the bleachers. This will make for a much smoother and
safer run event.


2. Most "Dominant
Academy" award - This title will be given to the academy (defined by a
single address/location. Not to be mistaken with affiliation/multi locations)
with the greatest number of submission finishes.


Important message to the academies


The academy of the registrants must
be EXACTLY the same to add the academy points and to avoid a match between teammates
in the 1st round of a bracket. For example- 'RSU' and 'Ring Sports United' will
NOT be considered as the same academy. You can change your academy by logging
into your account. Also IMPORTANT- ONLY the 'Academy' field in the registration
form will be taken into account for the Award for 'Most Dominant Academy'.
