who remain alone in their divisions once brackets are finalized, and have no
combinations available to them, they will receive a full coupon credit for
entry to any future Nebraska Jiu-Jitsu Championship event.


REGISTRATION
CANCELLATION POLICY: 


In the event you have to cancel your
registration, a full event credit will be provided automatically via SmoothComp. The cancellation deadline is by March 26th, 11:59 PM. After the deadline to
edit registration, all registrations are considered final with no event credit
available. Credits are issued when you log into your account and cancel your
event registration. Coupon codes are viewable in the “My Account” area of
SmoothComp. Competitors whose opponents no showed or withdrew from their
division, leaving them without a match on event day, will receive a full coupon
credit if there are no other appropriate divisions available.


BRACKETS AND
SCHEDULE: 


Friday Afternoon before the tournament, March 29th, the event brackets and schedule will be released. You will be able to
locate both on the event page brackets and schedule tab. At the tournament,
there will be a flat screen TV where the event schedule is displayed. The
referee at your mat will also make a courtesy call for you to


come to the mat
if you haven’t already presented yourself for the bracket. Please be at the mat
on time for your matches. We ask that you make sure to be present in the venue
at least 60 minutes prior to your division start time. Some matches end faster
than others, so this may allow us to start some divisions sooner. You can also see
when your matches are coming up by checking the tab on your mobile device
during the competition. The schedule is tentative and may change based on the number
of athletes registered.


COACH CHAIR and CROWD CONTROL:
We will have 1 chair on each side of
every score table, 1 for each coach of the competitor on the mat. The only
other people allowed within the barricades during the tournament are the
competitors on the mat having their match and the competitors on deck.


MEDIC ON HAND:
There will be a professionally trained medic on site.


WEIGH-INS: 


Weigh-ins begin at 8 AM the day of the
tournament. Athletes may weigh in throughout the day but must weigh-in at least
60 minutes prior to the start of their division. Athletes may wear whatever
appropriate attire they choose to weigh-in. You ARE NOT required to weigh in
with your Gi. If an athlete cannot make weight, they will be moved up to the
next available weight class, if there are no athletes in higher weight classes
you will be disqualified. Athletes will be given a 3 lbs. weight allowance. We
do this to ensure the integrity of the brackets. Registration may be edited by
the athlete until March 26th, 11:59 PM.


RULES: 


Nebraska Jiu-Jitsu Championship runs a
double elimination format. If there are two athletes in a division, it will be
the best 2 out of 3. If there are three athletes in a division, it will be
round-robin. If there are four or more athletes in a division, it will be
double elimination. There will be a match to determine a third place.  In the event of a tie, in the round robin
format, winners will be chosen based on fastest submission, if there is still a
tie, winner will be chosen by most points scored. There will not be any
overtime. The tournament will use the rule
set of the International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation (IBJJF), unless noted.
