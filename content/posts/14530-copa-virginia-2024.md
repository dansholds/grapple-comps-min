## Description
Are you looking for a tournament that runs on time and offers cash prizes?


Copa Virginia - 2024 is the tournament for you!


This is an all-ages tournament (6 years old and over).


There will be Gi and No Gi (Beginner - Intermediate - Advanced) divisions for men, women, kids, and juveniles.


Cash Prize for 1st Place:  $500 for Men's Adult Advanced No Gi Absolute 


All Black Belts compete for FREE in the Gi divisions ONLY. All Black Belts competing in Gi divisions need to initiate their registration online (without paying) and then contact us to finalize their registration.


Spectator Fees: $15 at the door. Coaches (brown and black belts only) of registered athletes enter for FREE. Academies can have one coach per 5 students registered for the event (2 coaches per 10 students, 3 for 15 etc.) Please email us no-later than 2 days before the event, with the coaches' names, so we can enter them on our guest list in time.


Depending on athlete turnout, we reserve the right to combine weight, age, belt. Please note that 16-17 years old participants may get combined with the adult (18 years old and over) divisions depending on turnout and/or upon request from parents/guardians.


Division mergers: Depending on athlete turnout we reserve the right to move athletes from the Masters age group to Adult. As far as weight divisions are concerned, we reserve the right to merge athletes with the weight division above the one they registered, but no more than that (unless provided permission to do so). If we cannot find at least one opponent for an athlete, despite all merging attempts, we'll refund them accordingly.


Refund policy: There will be no refunds for any reason unless an athlete cannot be matched with an opponent (please see above). No credit will be issued unless a valid reason can be provided. You can only request credit via email, do not cancel you registration until credit has been provided or told to do so.  There will be no credit provided past the registration deadline for any reason.


Editing registrations: Athletes have until the registration deadline to make any changes to their registration/division. No changes will be allowed after that.  


GI Divisions:


All Gi matches will be under IBJJF rules and weight divisions. To view them click here. We will have both Gi Adult and Gi Master (30+) age divisions. In order to sign up for any Gi absolute division you will need to be registered in a Gi weight division first.


Please make sure your Gi uniform adheres to IBJJF rules and regulations (i.e. no rashguard underneath the gi for males, same color top and pants is required, etc.). Per IBJJF rules White, Blue, and Black color Gis are the only colors allowed. 


Time limits for matches in the Gi (Men & Women 18 years old and over):


Adult - White Belt - 5min; Master - White Belt - 5min

No GI Divisions:


The
Beginner No Gi rules will be under IBJJF No Gi rules for white belts
belts (i.e. no jumping guard, straight ankle lock - the
only leg lock allowed). This division is intended for white belts in BJJ as well as athletes with very little grappling experience.


The Intermediate No Gi rules
will be under IBJJF No Gi rules for blue belts (i.e. straight ankle
lock - the only leg lock allowed). The division is intended for blue belts in BJJ as well as athletes with a
few years of grappling experience.


 All (Adult and Master) Advanced No Gi divisions will be under the IBJJF No Gi rules for Adult divisions\ blackbelts (i.e. all leglocks allowed, including heel hooks).
Due to the rule set for Advanced No Gi, we recommend participants with
multi-year experience in submission grappling (senior blue belts and
above). However, no official IBJJF ranking (i.e. having been awarded a
colored belt) is required to participate, as long as the athlete has the
necessary experience stated above.


In order to sign up for the Absolute Divisions for No Gi Beginner, Intermediate, and Female Advanced, you will need to be registered in a No Gi weight division first. That is NOT applicable for the Male Advanced No Gi Male Division (with a cash-prize).


Please make sure your No Gi uniform adheres to IBJJF rules and regulations (rashguards are required - no sleeveless ones, no t-shirts) with one major exception. There will be no color requirement on the rashguard and grappling shorts. That means athletes can wear whatever color/design rashguard and shorts they desire.


Time limits for all Beginner No Gi Matches will be 5 minutes.


Time limits for Adult Intermediate No Gi Matches will be 6 minutes; 5 minutes for Masters


Time limits for Adult Advanced No Gi matches will be 7 minutes; 6 Minutes for Masters

All athletes registered for Gi divisions will be weighed with their Gi on before their first match or at the beginning of the tournament (per IBJJF rules and regulations). Athletes registered for No Gi divisions will be weighed with their No Gi uniform. In the interest of time, if you feel comfortable about making weight, you can weigh-in with your Gi once for both your Gi and No Gi divisions. You will have 2 tries to make weight, if you do not make weight, you will be disqualified (you will only be allowed to compete in any Absolute divisions you have already registered).  There will be no refunds.

Please make sure you make the weight for the division you registered. 


You do not need to sign up for a Gi division if you only wish to compete in No Gi and vice versa.


Match times and brackets will be published 3-5 days before the day of the competition (an email will be sent to all the competitors notifying them when they get published).
