Welcome to the Windy City


The Windy City Circuit is proud to be hosting our next tournament on Sunday, June 2nd at the Feldman Park Recreation Center in Niles, IL.


This tournament is an invitation-only tournament focused on kids and teens. Our goal is to provide a fair, fun, and challenging environment for students to compete and display their skills.


Division FormatsBasics and Kata - Individual scores from judges, highest total wins. In the event of a 2-way tie, judges will break the tie through a show of hands. In the event of a 3-way tie or greater, tied competitors will perform again for a new score.Kata Absolute - Single elimination bracket. Competitors perform head to head with their opponent each round for a show of hands. Winner advances to the next round of competition.Sparring and BJJ - 2 person divisions will compete in a best-of-three to determine the winner. 3 person divisions will compete in a round robin format. Divisions of 4-6 will compete in a double elimination bracket. Divisions greater than 6 will be split into smaller divisions.


Rules - www.windycitycircuit.com/rules


THIS TOURNAMENT IS PRE-REGISTRATION ONLY! The deadline to sign up is Tuesday, May 28th at 11-59pm.


One Division - $25


Multiple Divisions - $40


Spectators free with a canned food donation


Merging DivisionsCompetitors who do not have an opponent in their division have the following options-


1 - Move up a division to compete as normal


2 - Cancel their registration for that division


3 - Perform an exhibition match individually (note that starting in 2025, exhibition matches will NOT earn ranking points)


Brackets and SchedulesWe require pre-registrations in order to create brackets and schedule our rings ahead of time. This allows us to contact competitors who are without an opponent to pick one of the above choices, as well as split up large divisions into smaller groups. We will release all brackets by the Thursday before the tournament, allowing competitors to see who and how many people they will face off against and to contact us if we made a mistake with division placement. This will also allow competitors and parents to see approximately what time their division will start and end along with what ring they will be in. Live match order can be viewed by returning to this page once the event starts and clicking on "Matches" at the top. For more information check out this article- https-//support.smoothcomp.com/article/90-find-out-your-dynamic-starting-time


Weigh-InsAll combat competitors (sparring and BJJ) will be required to weigh in upon check-in to confirm their division. We try as much as possible to pair students of similar size along with rank and age to keep fights as safe as possible. If you do not make the weight that you registered for, we will move you to the closest appropriate division. Please try to be as accurate as possible when registering. Sign up at your natural weight, we absolutely do not endorse cutting weight for children and teens.


Coach and Spectator EtiquetteCoaches are welcome to give direction to their students and spectators are encouraged to cheer for their students and teammates, however we have a strict policy in regard to etiquette. Any coaches, parents, competitors, or spectators of any kind who engage in profanity or make comments that are inappropriate or encouraging competitors to break rules will be removed from the event. This is a kids and teens tournament, keep it light-hearted and encouraging.


Awards and RankingsWinners of Basics and BJJ will receive bronze, silver, and gold medals for podium placements. Winners of Kata and Sparring will receive trophies for podium placements. The champion of the Kata Absolute will win a beautiful 4-foot tall trophy. All non-podium competitors will receive a souvenir medal for the day.
