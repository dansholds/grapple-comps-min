Time Limits and Match Procedure


All 8 Person Tournament Matches will consist of a- 7 minute regulation period.  During the regulation period no formal points will be awarded; however, the referee will be scoring the match in its entirety based on the Judging and Scoring Criteria (see below).  Upon expiration of the regulation period, should no submission occur, the referee will render a decision and the winner will advance.  The tournament is single elimination; but, should a match winner be unable to advance the referees will collaborate to chose an eliminated fighter to return to the competition as a replacement.  The tournament champion will be awarded $1000 cash.


Weight Classes


Each weight class has specific weight limits, and fighters must meet these limits during the official weigh-ins before their bouts.


The CS/R Phoenix Invitational will be held in 4 Weight Classes-


Featherweight Division - 149.9.lbs limit


Welterweight Division - 179.9lbs limit


Middleweight Division - 189.9lbs limit


Absolute Division - Open Weight 


Fighters typically do not undergo a weight-cutting process before the weigh-ins to meet their division’s limit. However, weight-cutting practices are allowed. Extreme weight-cutting practices that bring about concerns regarding fighter safety are not allowed.


Judging and Scoring Criteria


The referee is the sole arbiter of the match.  In the event of regulation time expiring with neither competitor securing a submission, it is the referee who evaluate the regulation period based on effective submission attempts, positional control, sweeps & reversals, takedowns & throws, and finally aggression.


Any submission attempt that disrupts a position or strategic approach will be considered an effective submission attempt.  The fighter with more significant attempts will be valued higher.


Positional control will be evaluated based on the ability to strike one’s opponent.  The fighter in position to strike for a longer duration of time will be valued higher.


Effective takedowns & throws can be defined as taking an opponent off their feet in a controlling and offensive manner. The attacker must maintain positional control for 2 full seconds after a takedown has been completed.


Slams are not permitted and are defined as malicious and intentionally driving one's opponent into the competition surface with force.

Intentional fleeing the competition area



Referees have the authority to penalize fighters for committing fouls and the authority to determine when a foul has occured. A warning may be issued for minor infractions, while more severe or repeated fouls can result in disqualification. The severity of the penalty depends on the referee’s discretion and the impact of the foul on the opponent.  Fighters must follow all instruction given by the referee.


Equipment and Attire


Fighters are required to wear specific equipment and attire to ensure their safety and fair competition. According to the Unified Rules of Submission Grappling, fighters must wear-



Approved shorts, spats, or gi pants, with no holes, pockets, or exposed zippers


Women must wear a sports bra or tight-fitting top



Medical Personel


There will be no medical personel on site to supervise this event.  Grapplers compete at your own risk.  The event coordinators, referees, venue, and staff assume no responsibility for any injuries, or bodily harm that may occur.  Our referees are there to stop a contest in the event of a submission but cannot prevent slips, trips, falls, or acts of god.  We ask you compete with the utmost of caution and deeply consider the risks assumed by entering this tournament. 


Conclusion


The Unified Rules of Submission Grappling provide a comprehensive framework for the sport, promoting fighter safety, fair competition, and consistency across events worldwide.  CSR Event rules and regulations are outlined almost entirely by the Unified Rules of Submission Grappling.


By understanding the regulations governing weight classes, judging criteria, fouls, attire, and more, fans and fighters can better appreciate the complexities of the sport and the efforts made to ensure its continued growth and development. As grappling continues to evolve, so too will the rules and regulations, adapting to the changing landscape and demands of the sport.
