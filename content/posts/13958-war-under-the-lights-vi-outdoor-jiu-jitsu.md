The first 50 athletes who signup and pay will have a $65 registration fee for one division or $100 for two divisions. Following 50 signups we will move to an $80 registration fee for one division or $120 for two divisions.


Everyone who signs up in the first 50 spots gets a free T-Shirt! You'll be prompted to select your size and color when signing up. Shirts will be at the event for everyone to pickup.

Tickets will be available in person at the door with cash or card. We encourage everyone to bring their families and friends to support the athletes. We will have seating for 650+ spectators on the field.

CLICK HERE FOR THE OFFICIAL LIST OF ILLEGAL TECHNIQUES FOR EACH BELT LEVEL


We will be using a slightly modified IBJJF ruleset with everyone's success and safety in mind. You can also take a look at our rules page by changing the tab at the top of the page.


We have also published an official rulebook with all of the appropriate information for our event! You can view the entire rulebook by clicking here.


Awards:


Divisions with 3 people will be round robin brackets (everyone fights everyone) and divisions with 4 people or more will be single elimination. 


Medals will be awarded to the 1st place, 2nd place and 3rd place winners of each division.


In the event of an athlete not having anyone else registered in their age or weight divisions we will combine divisions to make fair matchups. Children who are moved into another weight division due to being the only competitor in their division will be awarded a gold medal regardless of placement in the division they are moved into if the family desires. 


Athletes who do not compete are not guaranteed a medal at the event.


Team Trophies:


SmoothComp tracks the progress of each academy participating and awards points as competitors place in their respective divisions. At the end of the day we will award trophies to the top three overall academies of the day. 


BOUNTIES - CASH BONUS: 


Two submission techniques common to the sport will be shared on social media and in person at the event that, if performed during a match to force an opponent to tap out verbally or physically, will result in the fighter who performed the technique receiving $25 and a “Submission of the Night” certificate. The fighter does not have to win their respective division to receive the submission of the night award; the fighter only needs to win a match by way of either approved technique. Since names are commonly changed in the sport, examples of these techniques will be on display on our social media. The techniques are commonly referred to under the following names: 


1. STRAIGHT ANKLE LOCK (Adult divisions only)


2. BOW AND ARROW CHOKE 


The referee for your individual match will have all say in whether or not your techniques performed are eligible for a submission of the night bonus. Their decision is final. Athletes can perform these techniques to earn the submission of the night bonus in gi or no gi divisions. An athlete may only win one submission of the night bonus. Athletes are not encouraged to attempt techniques they are not familiar with and are encouraged to compete with their own safety in mind.   


WEIGH-INS:


ALL WEIGH-INS WILL BE THE DAY OF AT SITTON FIELD FIELD STARTING AT 3 PMEvery athlete can report to the weigh-in table, in front of the podium and award stage, starting at 3 PM the day of the competition, April 27th , at Sitton Field. No athletes need to weigh in with their gi on.


If an athlete does not make their weight on the first attempt they will have an hour from the time they first weigh-in to make the weight. 


There is a 1 pound weight allowance for athletes competing in no gi divisions. See why below.


There is no weight allowance for gi divisions since athletes will not weigh-in with their gi. See details below. See why below. 


Please make sure that you are in the correct weight division. You can change divisions up until the April 25th deadline. No changes will be accepted on the day of the tournament. No refunds will be given to disqualified athletes. 


Gi Example: - 107.0 lbs means athletes must weigh 107.0 lbs in a Gi division. Any weight over 107 lbs will result in disqualification. 


No Gi Example: - 107.0 lbs means athletes must weigh 107.0 lbs with a maximum of 108.0 lbs in a No Gi division. Any weight over 108 lbs will result in disqualification. 


No athletes are required to wear their gi for weigh-ins. Most gis are the same weight, so we are not requiring athletes competing in gi divisions to wear the gi since any two athletes who successfully make weight will weigh the same while wearing a gi. Athletes competing in both gi an no gi divisions are not required to wear their gi for weigh-ins. 


SCHEDULE/WEATHER:


The event will start at 5 PM and run until matches are finished around 9 o'clock so that everyone gets the Under the Lights experience. 


Brackets and schedules will be released Friday night April 26th. 


2 coaches per gym get in for free! Tell the front desk attendants which gym you are coaching for. 


The official matches and brackets will be released Friday night April 26th. 


Backup Indoor Venue:


The current forecast for April 27th shows no rain or clouds. For this tournament, we will have a backup indoor space at the University reserved in the very unlikely chance of rain. The event will not be postponed or cancelled under any weather circumstances, we will move the event indoors if we absolutely have to, but that is very unlikely at this time. 


Others:


Refunds will only be offered in the event of an athlete not getting any matches. If an athlete wishes to drop out for any other reason we will offer you a credit to a future competition. We host 2 competitions each year, so we will make up for your lost registration if you give notice that you are not able to make the event. Only notices of cancellation 48 hours prior to brackets being released will result in future competition credit. 


Athletes who place in 1st, 2nd and 3rd in their division will receive a medal at the event. All competitors must wear the uniform they competed in when on the podium. Gi winners must wear their gi on the podium and no gi winners are required to wear their no gi uniform. All the medals must be picked up at the event’s podium. Pretend Media Corporation is not responsible for shipping medals.


The Tower Grand Prix LLC reserves the right to close registration when we reach full capacity, or on the day of the appointed event registration deadline, whichever comes first.


It is the responsibility of the athlete to be knowledgeable of the rules and guidelines pertaining to the sport (as outlined in the IBJJF Rules Book). Please check the rules for the event here.


SAFETY PROTOCOL:


The safety of our competitors is our first priority. All referees will be experienced and know our rules and protocols to keep everyone as safe as possible. 


There will be medics on-site to access any injuries that occur during matches. 


Thank you all for your consideration in competing with us! We're excited to bring this opportunity to all of our local athletes at all ages.
