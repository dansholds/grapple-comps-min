BRACKETS AND SCHEDULE- The event brackets and schedule will be released Friday Morning May 3, 2024.  You will be able to locate both on the event page brackets and schedule tab.  All Battle Of Texas tournaments feature a large TV displaying the LIVE schedule by match order happening on each mat.  We will also make a courtesy call for you on the microphone to come to the mat if you also haven't already presented yourself for the bracket.  Please be at the mat on time for your matches.  We ask that you make sure to be present in the venue at least 30 minutes prior to your division start time as well in case we are able to get a head start on certain divisions. 


WEIGH-IN'S- Weigh-ins will take place on the day of the event for all Grappling and Sport MMA divisions.  You do not have to weigh-in with your gi on. You only need to weigh-in once if competing in several divisions. You must weigh-in anytime from the event opening until 30 minutes before your scheduled division start time. You must have officially weighed in by this 30 minutes before your division time and have made the weight, or else you will be disqualified and removed from the bracket. 


MEDIC ON HAND- There will be a trained and professional medic on sight to handle any injuries. 


WARM UP MATS- We try our best to provide a warm up area for our competitors during tournaments.  In case the event reaches close to our full capacity, we could be restricted from having floor space to create a warm up area for competitors. 


WORK AT THE EVENT- We are always looking for experienced referees, event staff, as well as competitors to help set up, tear down, and run the event.  We provide meals for day of workers.  To volunteer, please email us right away with your name, previous experience, and what you are willing to help with to [email protected].
