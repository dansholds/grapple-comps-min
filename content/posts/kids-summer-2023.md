<p>See tab above</p>

<h3>ARRIVAL TIME</h3>
<p>You only have to be at the event 30 minutes before you fight to sign in, warm up, and be ready to be weighed in.</p>

<h3>FIGHT TIMES</h3>
<p>We will only know fight times once registration has closed and brackets have been created. We estimate to have this information around 3rd August.</p>

<h3>MERGES</h3>
<p>We will be looking at the competitor list on 30th July and will start to make any necessary merges. Ideally, there should be at least 4 in a category in case someone does not show up, so fights can still go ahead. You also have the opportunity to merge/move yourself into another category on Check Day.</p>

<h3>PARKING</h3>
