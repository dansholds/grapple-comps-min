FORMAT and PROTOCOL: Grappling Industries tournaments follow a Round Robin Pool format meaning that all adult competitors get 4 matches for signing up for a division that fills up to 5 competitors. That means if you compete in both Gi and NoGi, you could get 8 plus fights. This allows you to compete against so many different people, giving you the experience you deserve! All Grappling Industries matches follow a points structure but without advantages! We are also very legal submission friendly!
