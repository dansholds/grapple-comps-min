ENTRY IS NOW OPEN TIME - Doors open 9.00am with first match at 10.00amDATE - Sunday February 16th 2025PLACE - Hutton Moor Leisure Centre Hutton Moor Rd, Weston-super-Mare BS22 8LY FIGHT MORE - PAY LESSSame great price but double the matches! Sounds good? As Bjj Black Belts we, the owners of Pro Sport Grappling know how important mat time is and how frustrating it can be when you only get one match at an event. That’s why for this event we aim to give all competitors a minimum of 2 matches per division, even if you lose your first match! So, for example if you enter both Gi and NoGi divisions we aim to give you at least 4 matches*. We also discount the additional division so it’s even better value for money.
  

STRAIGHT FINALS - best of 3 super-fightsTHREE IN A DIVISION  -  IBJJF Round Robin**FOUR OR MORE IN A DIVISION - Single elimination with consolation match (if you lose in the first round we aim to give you an additional match where possible)
  

    Please note that this does not apply to our absolute divisions which remain as the traditional straight knock out format.Please read the details on our extra match policy here
