## Description
This will be a great opportunity to showcase our grappling to the community under the most modern and exciting ruleset. There will be divisions separated by age, weight and skill and the tournament will be officiated by competitors as well as the event being live-streamed for folks that can’t make it to watch in person! Doors open at 8am but the event won’t start until 9. Make sure you arrive 45 min prior to your division. Look forward to seeing everyone April 27!
