All matches will follow IBJJF rules. To view them click here. 


Please make sure your Gi uniform adheres to IBJJF rules and regulations (i.e. no rashguard underneath the gi for males, same color top and pants is required, etc.)


All Advanced No Gi divisions will be under the NEW IBJJF No Gi rules for Adult divisions\ blackbelts (i.e. all leglocks allowed, including heel hooks). Due to the rule set for Advanced No Gi, we recommend participants with multi-year experience in submission grappling (senior blue belts and above). However, no official IBJJF ranking (i.e. having been awarded a colored belt) is required to participate, as long as the athlete has the necessary experience stated above.


Please make sure your No Gi uniform adheres to IBJJF rules and regulations (rashguards are required - no sleeveless ones, no t-shirts) with one major exception. There will be no color requirement on the rashguard and grappling shorts. That means athletes can wear whatever color/design rashguard and shorts they desire.
