CHANGING DIVISIONS-


All competitors, coaches, and parents will have until May 29th, 11-59 PM, prior to registration closing, to make any edits to their registrations. You can make these changes by logging into your account and modifying your registration details. At this deadline, registrations become finalized, and there will be no further changes allowed. Competitors who find themselves without another competitor in their division may choose to move themselves up in division (weight or rank) or cancel the registration for a full credit.


BRACKET COMBINATIONS-


After the deadline to edit registration info on May 29th, 11-59 PM, competitors who do not have anyone in their division will be combined into another appropriate division. All athletes who remain alone in their divisions once brackets are finalized, and have no combinations available to them, they will receive a full refund or a full coupon credit for entry to any future Kearney Combat Sports Tournament events.


REGISTRATION CANCELLATION POLICY-


In the event you have to cancel your registration, a full event credit will be provided automatically via SmoothComp. The cancellation deadline is by May 29th, 11-59 PM. After the deadline to edit registration, all registrations are considered final with no event credit available. Credits are issued when you log into your account and cancel your event registration. Coupon codes are viewable in the “My Account” area of SmoothComp. Competitors whose opponents no showed or withdrew from their division, leaving them without a match on event day, will receive a full coupon credit if there are no other appropriate divisions available.


BRACKETS AND SCHEDULE-


Friday Afternoon before the tournament, May 31st, the event brackets and schedule will be released. You will be able to locate both on the event page brackets and schedule tab. At the tournament, there will be a flat screen TV where the event schedule is displayed. The referee at your mat will also make a courtesy call for you to come to the mat if you haven’t already presented yourself for the bracket. Please be at the mat on time for your matches. We ask that you make sure to be present in the venue at least 60 minutes prior to your division start time. Some matches end faster than others, so this may allow us to start some divisions sooner. You can also see when your matches are coming up by checking the tab on your mobile device during the competition. The schedule is tentative and may change based on the number of athletes registered.


COACH CHAIR and CROWD CONTROL- We will have 1 chair on each side of every score table, 1 for each coach of the competitor on the mat. The only other people allowed next to the score table during the tournament are the competitors on the mat having their match and the competitors on deck.


MEDIC ON HAND- There will be a professionally trained medic on site.


WEIGH-INS-


Weigh-ins begin at 7-30 AM the day of the tournament. Athletes may weigh in throughout the day but must weigh-in at least 60 minutes prior to the start of their division. Athletes may wear whatever appropriate attire they choose to weigh-in. You ARE NOT required to weigh in with your Gi. If an athlete cannot make weight, they will be moved up to the next available weight class, if there are no athletes in higher weight classes you will be disqualified. Athletes will be given a 3 lbs. weight allowance. We do this to ensure the integrity of the brackets. Registration may be edited by the athlete until May 29th 11-59 PM.
