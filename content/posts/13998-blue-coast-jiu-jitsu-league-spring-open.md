The QUINTET Main Rule Set (minor adjustments/changes)


※GENERAL※-


l QUINTET is a Team grappling tournament. The Team wins a QUINTET match,


not the individual.


l Matches consist of two teams of five facing each other in a “winner stays on”


elimination format.


l Matches begin with one fighter from each team competing. This is called a


“round”. When a submission is scored, the round is over and the defeated


fighter is out of the match. The winning fighter, though, immediately faces


the next member of the opposing team in a new round.


l The match continues, round by round, fighter by fighter until one team is


completely eliminated.


※WAYS TO WIN※


l Submission/tapout/ref stops round


l Disqualification - for series foul


l Disqualification


l Round will be ruled a DRAW if no finish in the allotted time (both fighters are


then immediately eliminated from the match)


l Tie-Breakers


- Judgment- (in case of the last bout only) the fighter with less warnings


wins.


- In case of the same number of warnings in the last fight, the team with the


less total warnings wins. In case of the same total warnings, the judge


determines the result from the last fight by using a flag.

middle of the mat and the opponent puts both palms on the fighter’s waist.


The bout is started at the signal of the referee.
