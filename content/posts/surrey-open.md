  <li>We strongly suggest that athlete registration is finalized before making any travel arrangements.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Refund Policy</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The registration fee is non-refundable and non-transferable.</li>
  <li>SOBJJ cannot guarantee the athletes will show up for the tournament. Therefore, SOBJJ will not refund athletes who end up without a match due to a non-show for his/her opponent.</li>

If the athlete remains alone in the division by 5 PM, the refund will be processed.</li>
  <li>If an athlete’s division becomes populated with an additional athlete(s) on or before the Registration Checkday, the athlete will remain in their division and will no longer qualify for a refund.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Competition Day - Show up Time and Weigh-in</h3>

<h3>Athlete Alone in the Division</h3>
<p>Posted below are the three options for single-bracket competitors. Single-bracket competitors must inform IBJJF via email which option they choose by the 5 PM (event local time) on the event's Registration Checkday - admin@surreyopen.co.uk.</p>
<p>In the case that the division becomes populated with additional athletes during the Registration Checkday period, these options will no longer apply, and the athlete will remain in the original division.</p>

<h4>OPTION #1</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Athletes may stay in their current weight class, make weight, and receive the 1st place medal for the division.</li>
  <li>Once the athlete has had their weight and uniform checked, they will then be eligible to register for the Open Class division in the case that the age and belt division offers an Open Class division.</li>
  <li>Please note: Option #1 is the default option if athletes do not respond to admin@surreyopen.co.uk by 5 PM (event local time) before the Registration Checkday deadline.</li>
</ul>

<h4>OPTION #2</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Move up or down in age and/or weight division.</li>
  <li>By moving up or down in age and/or weight, athletes may be paired with an opponent. However, SOBJJ cannot guarantee that an opponent will be available. Athletes may select a second change option in case their first choice of division change is not available.</li>
  <li>Athletes can make their selection(s) after viewing the Athlete’s List by Division. The decision to move up or down in age and/or weight should be made solely at the athlete's discretion. If athletes choose OPTION 2 to change divisions, please be aware that athletes will be required to make weight for the new division. In order to request to change divisions, athletes will need to specify the exact division that they wish to be moved to. Athletes can specify a first and second choice (limited to the divisions available for the tournament).</li>
  <li>Master and Adult division athletes: Athletes can move up or down in age by specifying an age-eligible division determined by the athlete's birth year. For example, an athlete eligible to compete in Master 2 may move to Master 1 or Adult but may not move into Master 3 unless they are eligible.</li>
</ul>

<h4>OPTION #3</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Withdraw from the tournament if alone at 5 PM on the Registration Checkday.</li>
  <li>Athletes who are alone in their division on the Registration Checkday are eligible to receive a full refund of their tournament registration fee if they contact admin@surreyopen.co.uk PRIOR to the end of the Registration Checkday deadline. Refunds will be processed after 5 PM (event local time) if the athlete is still alone after the Checkday period.</li>
</ul>
