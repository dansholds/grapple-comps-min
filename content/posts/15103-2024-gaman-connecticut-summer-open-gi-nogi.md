COACHES AND SCHOOL OWNERS


Coaches and Competitors should make sure that your entire team selects the right TEAM NAME. Team points are calculated based on each individual name. If your team/school has many variants, your points will not be calculated correctly by Smoothcomp. We DO NOT do any manual counting.
