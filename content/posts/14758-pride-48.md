## Description
This event will run on time, according to the schedule which is
available online throughout the tournament. Competitors are expected in
the bullpen to be called to fight at the time according to the online
schedule. Competitors not present will be disqualified if they are not
present within 5 minutes of their scheduled fight time.


By IBJJF regulations, youths 12 and younger can be grouped in the same
bracket. When possible, we will split into separate boys and girls
brackets, but depending on the size of the bracket, they may be
combined.


Generally, juveniles (16-17 years old) are not permitted to fight in the
adults bracket. However, we will try to offer an extra fight for
juveniles, if we also have a willing 18 year old fighter that is the
same weight and belt. If both parties agree, we will attempt to arrange a
special fight.


Competitors with incomplete or unpaid registrations will be removed from the bracket when the registration is closed.


Be the first one to register in your division and be surprise seeing other competitors follow you!
