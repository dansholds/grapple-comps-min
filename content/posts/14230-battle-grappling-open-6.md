Battle Grappling


"By Athletes, For Athletes"


Battle Grappling is one of the premier grappling tournaments in the Pacific Northwest. The Battle Grappling Open Tournament is a round-robin, submission-only tournament featuring the best up and coming grapplers in the area!


Battle Open is an opportunity to show your art and your skill on the mats and earn the chance to compete in our paid, pro grappling show, Battle Grappling! 


If these aren't your weight classes don't worry! We're always looking out for the best grapplers in the area and performing well in any division, weight class, or skill level (Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced) might result in being invited to the pro show. 


When and where


Battle Open will be held on Saturday, May 25th.


Weigh in begins 10 am, rules meeting will be at 12 pm. Matches start at 1 pm. 


The event will be hosted at Bellingham Mixed Martial arts-


2694 Roeder Ave, Suite 101,Bellingham, WA 98225


Weigh-in and check in


Weigh ins will be held between 10 am and  12 pm on the day of the event (Saturday, May 25th). Once the rules meeting has begun no further weigh ins will occur. 


Athletes are expected to weigh in ready in their competition gear (Rash Guards and shorts or spats. It is not necessary to weigh in the Gi). Once an athlete has weighed in they are good to go and do not need to weigh in again. 


If an athlete fails to make weight by 12 pm they will be disqualified. If an athlete needs to move weight division this must be communicated to event staff before 12 pm.

All Divisions-



No fish-hooking, eye gouging, or maiming techniques are allowed. No slamming your opponent is allowed.

All takedowns are legal, though it is expected that if a competitor lifts their opponent off of their feet they will attempt to turn them shoulder/back down to the mat. No spiking or throwing a competitor on their head.




All upper-body joint lock submissions are legal, as well as all strangling and choking submissions using the arms, legs, or collar/lapel (in the Gi). 


No striking of any kind.

Bracket points and determining the winner


All brackets are round-robin. This means that each athlete will have a match against each other athlete in that bracket (maximum 4 matches in one division).


To determine bracket progression-



3 points for a win (submitting your opponent).


1 point for a draw (no submission at the end of the regulation period).


0 points for a loss.



The athlete with the highest point total once all matches in a bracket are complete will be assigned 1st place, with the athlete earning the next highest point total in 2nd place, and so on. 


Brackets with 6 or more competitors will be split into two round-robin pools. The top two competitors from each pool will advance to a 4-person single elimination bracket to determine final placement.


Any point ties will be decided by head-to-head match results. If the head-to-head match results were a tie (no submission in regulation time) the athlete with the lowest total match time in regulation competition will be awarded the victory.
