## Description
The Shrimp Roll is scrimmage for jiu-jitsu youth in the DMV & East Coast area. Your child will have an opportunity to test their jiu-jitsu in a safe & controlled environment. Your child may register as a competitor and end by submission (ages 8 to 15) or register for an exhibition match ending by time (ages 5 to 7). 


If your child has already competed in local tournaments (The Good Fight, PBJJF, New Breed, etc) please register them as a competitor. Competitor matches will end by submission or time. If your child has ZERO experience competing, they may register for an exhibition match and end by time. 


ALL MATCHES WILL BE IN THE GI. 


Participants will be matched by age, rank, aggression, and control levels to the best of our ability. 


Matches will be 3 minutes in length for participants ages 5 to 12, and 4 minutes for participants ages 13 to 15.
