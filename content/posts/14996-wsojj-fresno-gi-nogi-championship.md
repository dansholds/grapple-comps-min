COMPETITOR LISTS- Throughout the registration process, you can access the live Competitor Lists by visiting the registrations tab on the event page. We strongly encourage everyone to log in before the last day of registration and review their details, as well as the competitor lists. It's important not to wait until the brackets are published and locked in to confirm this information.


CHANGING DIVISIONS- After registration closes, all competitors (or coaches and parents) have until 5PM the following day to make any changes to their registrations. To make changes, simply log into your account and modify your registration details. Once this deadline passes, the registration will be locked, and no further changes will be allowed. Competitors who are the only ones in their division can choose to either move up a division on their own or cancel their registration for a full credit. If you encounter any issues while changing your division, please refer to- https-//support.smoothcomp.com/article/89-how-to-change-weightclass-or-cancel


DIVISION MERGERS- After the change deadline, competitors who do not have any other participants in their division may be merged with another division. Athletes who remain without opponents in their divisions after the brackets are released will not have any matches available. In such cases, they will receive a full coupon credit that can be used for entry to any future event of ours.


REFUND POLICY- We provide refunds for event registrations until the early bird date. From the early bird date until the change deadline, only full coupon credits will be issued for future events. After the change deadline, no refunds or future credits will be issued. To obtain a refund or credit, log into your account and cancel your event registration. Competitors who do not have a bracket when registration closes will receive a full coupon credit for a future event. The no-show credit only applies if you have no matches scheduled for the day. If you fail to show up to your match and there are competitors in your bracket, you will be disqualified and your opponents will be given the win.


BRACKETS and SCHEDULE- The event brackets and schedule will be released 48 hours prior to the tournament. You can find both on the event page's brackets and schedule tab. We will make an announcement on the microphone to call you to the mat if you haven't already presented yourself for the bracket. Please ensure that you arrive at the mat on time for your matches. We recommend being present at the venue at least 45 minutes before your division's start time, as we may be able to begin certain divisions earlier. You can also check the tab on your mobile device during the competition to see when your matches are coming up- https-//support.smoothcomp.com/article/90-find-out-your-dynamic-starting-time
