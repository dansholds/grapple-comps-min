WEIGH-INS


YOUTH DIVISIONS- 8-30AM


ADULT DIVISIONS- 9-00 AM


All weigh-ins will take place all day once all youth divisions are weighted in. Competitors are expected to be checked-in, weighed-in, warmed up and ready to compete 1 hour prior to their scheduled division.


GI Competitors weigh-in WITH THE GI ON.


We tolerate a 1 pound allowance.


Absolute divisions will start after the divisions are completed. You must medal in your own division to be eligible for absolutes.


It is the athlete’s responsibility to be on weight and make sure they are registered in the correct weight division, rank, and team on the competitor list.


In the occurrence that an athlete cannot make weight, he/she should contact us immediately before the registration MODIFICATION/CORRECTION deadline (supposed to be yesterday). The day of the tournament, we will no longer accept registration corrections, athletes who fail to make weight will be disqualified with no refund.





ALL adult divisions will be DOUBLE-ELIMINATION. Kids divisions will be DOUBLE-ELIMINATION.
