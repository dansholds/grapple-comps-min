## Description
This is a gi and no-gi tournament. There will be divisions for both kids and adults.  Youth divisions will be double elimination, and adult divisions will be single elimination!


So what can you expect from this event? Well let's go over the details, some of which are new changes from previous tournaments.


First off, we are implementing a new simplistic point system, along with a new passivity ruleset.  With the two of these in play, it'll mean fewer overtimes, and an easier scoring system for the average parent, competitor, and coach to understand.  Please make sure to watch the videos discussing the new ruleset on our website.


There will be both gi and no-gi divisions. Kids/Teens will be separated by age brackets, weight limits, and skill. There will be adult divisions for men, women, and men's masters (40 yrs and older).  There will be divisions for white belts, blue belts.


New to the tournament will be MONEY MATCHES!  These are single, pre-arranged matches between 2 competitors (like a superfight).  Competitors can register for a money match for $50, and whoever wins the match, takes home $100.  Money matches are ONLY for purple, brown, and black belts.  They can be either gi, or no gi.  Both competitors must agree to their matchup for it to be official, and must weigh in within their designated weight bracket.


Your registration will allow you to compete in up to 2 divisions.  For kids/teens, this is a double elimination tournament! Which means, you have to lose twice in order to be eliminated from your division. So if you compete in 2 divisions, you will get a minimum of 4 matches!


We'll also be adding an ALL GIRLS 13-17 year old division.  We know that when it comes to teenagers, the gap in speed and strength starts to widen between boys and girls, so in an effort to keep the playing field more even, all girls 13 and over can jump into this new division, facing just other girls.  Girls will still have the option to go into the regular divisions and face boys if they choose to, but they don't have to.


We'll be bringing back a no-gi absolute division for adults!  There will 2 no-gi absolutes for men, split into LIGHTWEIGHT and HEAVYWEIGHT.  It's an all no-gi absolute, and anyone can enter it regardless of belt rank.  The absolute divisions will take place at the beginning of the tournament, alongside the youth matches.  There won't be any gi absolute divisions.


We are also going to be using the Smoothcomp system for our checkout, and for our match scheduling throughout the day. With the Smoothcomp system, every fighter will have an exact scheduled time showing when their next match is taking place. You will be able to see this schedule on your cell phone, along with the brackets and other competitors, and it will update as the day goes on!


Registration for Grappling Gods 2 is only $50 for 2 divisions.  If you register by July 13th, you will receive a free patch with your registration!


So mark your calendars, train hard, prepare yourself for an awesome day of competition, and register asap!
