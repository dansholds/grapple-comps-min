REGISTRATION- Registration will close on Wednesday, 08/14/2024 at 5 PM. We may be accepting registrations at the door until 8-30 AM on the day of the event (to be announced on Thursday, 08/15/2024). ($65 for 1 or 2 divisions, Discount will be attributed on checkout)


TIME EXPECTATION- Controlled Combat has a goal to finish a competitor's bracket within 45 minutes/division. For example, if a competitor is in the 5/6 year old, 50 lbs, grey belt, Gi and No GI divisions that start at 9-00 AM then the goal of Controlled Combat is to finish by 10-30 AM. This means there will not be an extended time between the Gi and No Gi brackets! We understand that it is a long, tiring day for all involved. Controlled Combat wants to provide the option of staying to enjoy the exhibition of Jiu Jitsu but realizes an extended break between brackets or an 8-hour day for 3-10 matches is exhausting. 


WEIGH INS- Weigh in will be available at Hot Box Boxing and Sports Performance from 8-00 AM EST on the day of the event Saturday, August 17, 2024. It is critical that competitors are weighed in at least 45 minutes prior to their scheduled start time. Competitors may weigh in with or without their Gi on. There are no restrictions. NOTE- Controlled Combat builds in the weight allowance to the division. There are NO additional weight allowances to the division. A competitor must be within that range to compete or moved up in weight to the next division. 


SPECTATORS- $15/Spectator - Cash or Credit


AWARDS- Gold Medal winners will receive a Controlled Combat Champions Rash Guard or Hoodie and a Gold Medal! Silver medal winners will receive a Silver Medal. Bronze medal winners will receive a Bronze Medal. All medals are custom made and unique to each event. In addition, every event will offer a different "Champions" gear. This includes, but not limited to board shorts, rash guards, slides (sandals), etc. 


ATHLETE SPONSORSHIP- Controlled Combat may offer Athlete Sponsorships throughout all events. The sponsorship includes a special "Athlete" rash guard and free registrations to any future Controlled Combat event! This does not limit competitors to only competing at Controlled Combat events. 


COMPETITORS/REGISTRATIONS- Competitors/Registrations can be viewed through the "Registrations" tab on Smoothcomp throughout the registration process. NOTE- There may be some changes due to age, weight, or belt ranks from time of registration to event start time.


TOURNAMENT FORMAT- Controlled Combat utilizes a Round Robin style tournament to maximize the number of matches a competitor can have. There is a maximum of 4 matches per division with potential for a Gold/Silver Medal and Bronze Medal Match. If a competitor competes in both Gi and No Gi then they can have 8 non medal matches with up to 2 additional medal matches. 


BRACKETS and SCHEDULE- Brackets and Schedules will be released by 8-00 PM on Friday, August 16, 2024. All in attendance will be able to view the schedule on the projector screen at the event. NOTE- You can view the mat and competitor schedules through Smoothcomp, Brackets and schedule tab. The match times are dynamic and will move throughout the day. In addition, Controlled Combat utilizes a "bullpen" system. All coaches and competitors are to be in the bullpen and prepared to grapple. 


EXHIBITION MATCHES- Exhibition matches are available for those competitors interested in the tournament experience but do not want to have a win or loss attributed to their record. If you would like to participate in an exhibition match/bracket then note this in the "Comments" section within registration.

TIPS (For First Time Competitors or a Reminder for Seasoned Competitors)-


     - Try not to overthink what a Jiu Jitsu tournament is. Although it is a competition, having fun and bringing together the Jiu Jitsu community is the top priority. A competitor should want to continue competing and meeting new friends every event. 


     -Upon arrival at the event you will go to the "Check in" table. This is where you will show the tickets you purchased and receive direction from a Controlled Combat team member on where to go. If you are or have a competitor, you will then go to the weigh in line. After the competitor is weighed in, they may enter the arena and set up in their preferred location and view vendors available/warm up. 


     - Smoothcomp "Brackets and schedule" Is a tremendous resource. Use it to view what mat a competitor is on, follow the dynamic schedule, and view results. Refresh it often!


     - Jiu Jitsu tournaments can be a long day. Controlled Combat prides itself on its logistical planning and has a goal of finishing a bracket within 45 minutes, but there are times when this is not feasible. Utilize concessions available at the event and/or bring some snacks/drinks. Pro tip- Uno or another card game is a wonderful time killing alternative prior to the event beginning or between brackets if there is an extended break. 


     - Do not tire yourself out prior to your match and make sure to appropriately stretch in preparation of competition. The bullpen area will assist with this, but it is up to the competitor to adequately prepare themself for a grappling match not only to prevent injury, but to get into the competitive mindset. 


     - As a competitor, be ready to report to the bullpen. A "walkover" or disqualification may occur if a competitor is not available within 90 seconds of the match start time. 


     - Wear the belt in which you have earned for competition. Often, a youth, grey with white stripe belt may be in their first tournament. Have a discussion with your coach. There are many very competitive youths out there and grey belt may not be the appropriate division to compete in. If a competitor signs up for white belt and is wearing their grey with white stripe, then they will NOT be allowed to compete in the white belt division. The intent of this tip is not to encourage "sandbagging", but to be aware of the belt restriction. 


     - Before a match, a competitor will report to the bullpen and then the mat which their bracket is competing. The competitor will stand by the edge of the mat until the referee calls both competitors to the mat. Competitors should bow when entering the mat and then set up for their match as directed by the referee. The competitor should shake hands with their opponent. Once the match is complete the referee will raise the hand of the winner and competitors should shake their opponent's coach's hand and then report back to their coach.
