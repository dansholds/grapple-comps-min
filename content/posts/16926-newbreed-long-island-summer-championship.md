## Description
NJJF returns to Island Garden Basketball on July 13th for the Long Island Summer
Championship! This premier event will bring together the best athletes
from across the state to compete for NJJF gold.


No matter your age or experience, we've got a division that's perfect
for you. Test your technique and push your limits in both gi and no-gi
divisions. It's your chance to shine and show off your skills.


Stand tall on the podium as we reward the top three athletes in each
division with beautifully crafted custom medals. A symbol of your hard
work and dedication to the sport.


First-place winners in any advanced division will make a name for
themselves by claiming the prestigious NJJF Championship Belt. Are you
ready to rise to the challenge?


This event will be a qualifier for The Ultimate Grappler. The winner of
the nogi absolute division will secure their spot at The Ultimate
Grappler Finale December 6th in Greenville, SC with a chance to win the
$5,000 prize!


Team points are calculated to determine the top three teams in the Youth
and Adult categories, as well as the Overall team champion. All seven
teams will receive a distinguished award banner to proudly hang in their
academy, with the first place winners of each category taking home an
NJJF team trophy!


Register now and get ready to earn your place on the NEWBREED podium at the Long Island Summer Championship. We'll see you on the mat!
