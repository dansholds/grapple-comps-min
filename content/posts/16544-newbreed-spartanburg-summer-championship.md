## Description
Get ready to put your jiu jitsu to the test at the Spartanburg Summer
Championship! Join us at theÂ Upward Star Center on June 22nd for one of the most
exciting tournaments of the season.


No matter your age or skill level, there's division for you at this
tournament. And with custom medals awarded to the top three athletes in
each division, you'll have the chance to showcase your skills and earn
recognition for your hard work.


If you're a more experienced athlete, you'll be aiming for the prized
NJJF Championship Belt, which will be awarded to the first place winners
of any advanced division.


For those seeking the toughest challenge, the nogi absolute division
will be a true battleground where only the best of the best will emerge
victorious.


But it's not just about individual glory. At the end of the tournament
team points will be calculated to determine the top three teams in the
youth and adult categories, as well as the one overall team champion.
All seven teams will receive an award banner to display in their
academy, and the first-place winning teams will take home a custom
trophy.


This is your chance to take your game to the next level this summer! So
get in the gym and get ready to earn your place on the NJJF podium.
We'll see you on the mat!
