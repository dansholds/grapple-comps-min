Weigh-ins will be available on Saturday starting at 10-00 AM. We ask that competitors are weighed-in 60 minutes prior to the scheduled start time for your first division, especially those competing later in the day as we often run ahead of schedule.


You will be required to wear clothing (t-shirt and shorts) while weighing in. You WILL NOT be allowed to disrobe or "strip" to your underwear, so please plan accordingly.


Because you are required to weigh in clothed, there will be a 2 LBS ALLOWANCE for all competitors to account for the weight of your clothing.


You will not be allowed to switch divisions the day of the event. All changes and edits to your registration must be made by the edit/change deadline on Thursday June 13th at 11-59 PM.


If you are unable to make the registered weight before the start of your first match - you will be DISQUALIFIED.


Competitor Lists-


Competitors lists will be available to view throughout the registration period under the "Participants" tab on the Smoothcomp event page.


If you do not see anybody registered for your division - register anyways! In the event that we are not able to place you in a fair division, you will receive a full refund or the option to transfer your registration credit to a future event.


Brackets & Schedules-


Event brackets and schedule will be available to view on the event page (Brackets and Schedule tab) no later than 12-00 PM Central on Thursday June 13th.

Registration Edits-


You will have until 11-59 PM on Thursday June 13th to make any necessary changes to your registration. Changes to your registration can be made by logging into your account and editing your registration details. 


After this time, you will not be able to make any changes or edits to your registration.
