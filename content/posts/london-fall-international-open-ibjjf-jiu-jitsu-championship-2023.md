<p>The competitors who are willing to participate in the Open Class divisions must have a flexible schedule in order to be available for the start time of the division, whenever that may be.</p>

<h3>IMPORTANT INFO</h3>

<h4>Registration</h4>

<p>We try to accommodate as many athletes as possible in our events comfortably, but there is a limit on the number of athletes in order to guarantee a high-quality event.</p>

<p>IBJJF reserves the right to close registration when we reach full capacity, or on the day of the appointed event registration deadline, whichever comes first.</p>

<p>We strongly suggest that athlete registration is finalized before making any travel arrangements.</p>

<p>Any false information provided during registration such as, but not limited to, DOB, may lead to immediate disqualification. Such actions are subject to suspension or even banishment from future IBJJF events.</p>

<h4>Refund Policy</h4>

<p>The registration fee is non-refundable and non-transferable.</p>

<p>IBJJF cannot guarantee the athletes will show up for the tournament. Therefore, IBJJF will not refund athletes who end up without a match due to a non-show for his / her opponent.</p>

<p><em>Exemption:</em> Athletes who are alone in their division are eligible to receive a full refund of the registration if they contact ibjjf@ibjjf.com and request to withdraw their name from the competition on the day of the tournament’s Registration Checkday, before 5 PM (event local time). If the athlete remains alone in the division by 5 PM, the refund will be processed.</p>

<p><em>If an athlete’s division becomes populated with an additional athlete(s) on or before the Registration Checkday, the athlete will remain in their division and will no longer qualify for a refund.</em></p>

<p>For more detailed information regarding athletes who are alone in their division, please refer to the "Athlete Alone in the Division" section found below.</p>

<h4>Competition Day - Show up Time and Weigh-in</h4>

<p>It is the responsibility of the athlete to be knowledgeable of the rules and guidelines pertaining to the sport (as outlined in the IBJJF Rules Book).</p>

<p>It is mandatory to have an official government photo ID or an IBJJF membership card at all times. Before each fight, athletes will be asked to show their valid form of photo identification (ID) to the officials. Make sure you have it on hand.</p>

<p>If you have any issues regarding your ID documents, please go to the Customer Service booth when it is available, or the Administration Table.</p>

<p>Refer to the schedule link in order to know when you should be at the event ready to compete and inside the warm-up area.</p>

<p>Competitors must be at the venue ready to compete, one hour prior to the start time for their division in the case the tournament is running earlier than expected.</p>

<p><em>The division start time posted in the event’s schedule is an estimated start time only. The division start time can vary throughout the event day due to several factors that are beyond our control.</em></p>

<p>The official weight measurements of this event are in KILOGRAMS.</p>

<p>Official weigh-in will occur immediately before the first fight. Only one attempt to make weight is allowed.</p>

<p>Be advised the athletes will be disqualified in their division if they weigh in heavier than the weight listed for the division they registered in.</p>

<p>Athletes are subject to blood and/or urine testing for any substance or method on the World Anti-Doping Agency (“WADA”) Prohibited List (click <a href="https://www.wada-ama.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> to view). You may review the WADA Code by clicking <a href="https://www.wada-ama.org/en/code/signatories-and-compliance/wada-code" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<h4>Athletes Under 18 Years Old</h4>

<p>Athletes 18 years old or younger, who have previously worn a belt from a belt rank that does not exist for their current age range, according to the IBJJF Graduation System, will only be allowed to compete in a belt rank that matches that athlete's current age group.</p>

<p>For tournaments with a spectator fee, athletes registered in the Juvenile divisions are allowed to enter with one companion for free, as long as the companion checks in at the entrance venue at the same time as the athlete enters the venue.</p>

<h4>Black Belt Coaching Area</h4>

<p>If the tournament doesn't have a coaching area available, coaching will be prohibited within the barricaded area/competition area. Coaching will be allowed outside of the barricaded area only.</p>

<p>If the tournament has a specific designated area for coaches, only coaches with valid IBJJF Black Belt membership ID will be allowed inside the coaching area.</p>

<p>Black Belt Coaches will need to have valid membership prior to the competition day. Memberships will not be renewed in person at the event.</p>

<h4>Athlete Alone in the Division</h4>

<p>Posted below are the three options for single-bracket competitors. Single-bracket competitors must inform IBJJF via their registered email which option they choose by 5 PM (event local time) on the event's Registration Checkday - ibjjf@ibjjf.com.</p>

<p>In the case that the division becomes populated with additional athletes during the Registration Checkday period, these options will no longer apply and the athlete will remain in the original division.</p>

<p><strong>OPTION #1</strong></p>

<p>Athletes may stay in their current weight class, make weight, and receive the 1st place medal for the division.</p>

<p>Once the athlete has had their weight and uniform checked, they will then be eligible to register for the Open Class division in the case that the age and belt division offer an Open Class division.</p>

<p>Please note: Option #1 is the default option if athletes do not respond to ibjjf@ibjjf.com by 5 PM (event local time) before the Registration Checkday deadline.</p>

<p><strong>OPTION #2</strong></p>

<p>Move up or down in age and/or weight division.</p>

<p>By moving up or down in age and/or weight, athletes may be paired with an opponent. However, IBJJF cannot guarantee that an opponent will be available. Athletes may select a second change option in case their first choice of division change is not available.</p>

<p>Athletes can make their selection(s) after viewing the Athlete’s List by Division. The decision to move up or down in age and/or weight should be made solely at the athlete's discretion. If athletes choose OPTION 2 to change divisions, please be aware that athletes will be required to make weight for the new division. In order to request to change divisions, athletes will need to specify the exact division that they wish to be moved to. Athletes can specify a first and second choice (limited to the divisions available for the tournament).</p>

<p>Master and Adult division athletes: Athletes can move up or down in age by specifying an age-eligible division determined by the athlete's birth year. For example, an athlete eligible to compete in Master 2 may move to Master 1 or Adult but may not move into Master 3 unless they are eligible.</p>

<p>Juvenile division athletes: Juvenile division athletes can move from Juvenile 1 to Juvenile 2 (if applicable) when alone in their bracket on the Registration Checkday. Juvenile athletes will not be allowed to move to the Adult division. <em>The request to move up one age division must be done by the parent/legal guardian registered on the athlete's IBJJF account.</em></p>

<p><strong>OPTION #3</strong></p>

<p>Withdraw from the tournament if alone at 5 PM on the Registration Checkday.</p>

<p>Athletes who are alone in their division on the Registration Checkday are eligible to receive a full refund of their tournament registration fee if they contact ibjjf@ibjjf.com PRIOR to the end of the Registration Checkday deadline. Refunds will be processed after 5 PM (event local time) if the athlete is still alone after the Checkday period.</p>

<h4>Teams</h4>

<p>Each team can only have two athletes in the same division bracket of age/weight/belt. If your team has more than two athletes in the same division, the Professor needs to email ibjjf@ibjjf.com prior to the Professor Correction Period deadline in order to edit their student’s registration. This rule does not prevent you from registering for the event.</p>

<p>Athletes from the exact same team will not fight against each other before the final match, except in a three-athlete bracket.</p>

<h4>Medals and Trophy</h4>

<p>Athletes who place 1st, 2nd, and 3rd in their division will receive a medal at the event.</p>

<p>All the medals should be picked up at the event's podium. IBJJF does not mail out unclaimed or lost medals after the tournaments.</p>

<p>There will be only one group trophy for this event.</p>
