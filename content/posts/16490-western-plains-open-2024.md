## Description
We are excited to host the Western Plains Open in conjunction with the Cowboy State Games on June 1, 2024! This is a double elimination Gi and No Gi BJJ Tournament. As in the past, we will have the kids compete in the morning, and adults after that. There will be Men's Gi and No Gi Absolutes at the end of the event. If there is interest for a Women's Absolute, please let me know and I will create one!  


PRICING-  Your 1st division is $75. Any additional division is only $15 more. For example, if you enter Adult Gi and No Gi, it is a total of $90. Add the absolute and it is only $105. A lot of rolling for pretty cheap!


CHANGING DIVISIONS- After registration closes, all competitors (or coaches, parents) have until 5PM the following day to make any changes to their registrations. You can make these changes by logging into your account and modifying your registration details. After this change deadline, the registration will become locked in, and there will no further changes allowed. Please email [email protected] to make changes.   


WEIGH-INS- Takes place on the day of the event. You do not have to weigh-in with your gi on. You only need to weigh-in once if competing in several divisions. You must weigh-in anytime from the event opening until 60 minutes before your scheduled division start time. You must have officially weighed in by this hour before your division time and have made the weight, or else you will be disqualified and removed from the bracket.  


Bracketing will only occur after registrations are closed. Every effort will be made to bracket team members apart from one another. Make sure to spread the word. The more schools that attend, the less chance of rolling against a teammate!


DOORS OPEN AT 8 AM.  MATCHES START AT 9 AM.
