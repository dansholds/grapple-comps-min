Event rules


Competitors must weigh in at least 1 hour before their first match. It is not required to wear a gi for weigh in. Each team is permitted up to 2 coaches as cornermen.


For NOGI divisions, acceptable clothing must be worn. This means no zips or other metal parts, no loose tops such as t-shirts or tank tops, and no pockets. Grappling shorts and a rash guard are recommended for nogi, and competing without a top is optional.


For GI divisions, gis must be in good condition, thick enough for grappling (ie no karate gis), and a reasonably good fit for the competitor. The correct colour belt must be worn. For GI, the experience categories roughly correspond to BJJ belts as follows:


Novice -- white belt.


Intermediate -- blue belt.


Professional -- purple belt and above.


Rules by division


Expert: No strikes, leg scissor takedowns (kani basami), small joint manipulations, slams out of submissions from above shoulder height, biting, gouging, or fishhooking of the mouth, nose, etc.


Intermediate: As above, plus no suplexes, spinal locks, or slams out of submissions from any height.


Novice: As above, plus no twisting leglocks (such as toe holds, heelhooks, etc), jumping guard, hip joint locks, wrist locks.


Smothering / suffocation is illegal.


Other general info


We have single elimination rounds, round robin elimination rounds and a head 2 head best of three elimination rounds. 


If time allows (depending on registration numbers) we may run additional matches within each category for experience only.


Weight and/or age categories may be merged if too few competitors register for any given category. Merges will begin from mid February and we will consult with affected competitors in the lower weight/upper age division being merged where possible.
