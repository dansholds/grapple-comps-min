FORMAT and PROTOCOL- Grappling Industries tournaments follow Round Robin formatting meaning that all adult competitors get 4 matches for signing up for a division that fills up to 5 competitors. That means if you compete in both Gi and NoGi, you could get 8 plus fights. This allows you to compete against so many different people, giving you the experience you deserve! All Grappling Industries events follow the traditional points structure but without advantages! We are also very legal submission friendly!
