## Description
TeamPolice BJJ are back for 2024! Our next national championships, scheduled for 22nd June 2024, will be held at Jackton Police College in Glasgow, Scotland courtesy of our hosts for the day, Police Scotland. In line with our aim to continually grow what we do for our policing colleagues across the UK and beyond, we have listened to what you want and are proud to be running our first Gi and NoGi championships on the same day! 


Competitors will have the opportunity to compete in both the Gi and NoGi divisions as well as the absolute categories in both. So plenty of opportunities for silverware, whatever your preferred discipline! Competitors wishing to register anonymously should email us at [email protected] for instructions on how to do this. Friends and family will be welcome to come and support but will expected to wear visitor passes and will be the responsibility of the officer they are supporting - this is an operational Police premises. All competitors will be expected to bring and show their Police ID card/warrant card to be permitted entry to the site.


Last year saw the growth of competitive BJJ in the UK Policing community develop more than ever before in recorded history! We now have a league table representing all forces across the UK which Police Scotland topped at the end of 2023. Book your leave, register for the event and lets see who will take home the medals this year and put their force top of the table!
