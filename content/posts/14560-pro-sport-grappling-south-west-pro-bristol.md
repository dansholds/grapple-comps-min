the owners of Pro Sport Grappling know how important mat time is and how
frustrating it can be when you only get one match at an event. That’s why for
2024 we aim to give all competitors a minimum of 2 matches per division, even
if you lose your first match! So, for example if you enter both Gi and NoGi
divisions we aim to give you at least 4 matches*. We also discount the
additional division so it’s even better value for money.STRAIGHT FINALS - best of 3 super-fightsTHREE IN A DIVISION  -  IBJJF Round Robin**FOUR OR MORE IN A DIVISION - Single elimination with
consolation match (if you lose in the first round we aim to give you an
additional match)FREE T-SHIRTAlso don’t forget to order your FREE event T-Shirt supplied by Smash Jiu
