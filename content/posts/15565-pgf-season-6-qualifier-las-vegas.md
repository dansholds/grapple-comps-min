PGF 6 will take place in Las Vegas, NV on April 21-26, so if you think you are gonna make the roster you need to be in Las Vegas and Game ready on those days. You will compete in 12 matches during the week, with the top 8 moving on to the tournament on Friday.

The rest of the roster will be chosen from invitations and Qualifier participants.
