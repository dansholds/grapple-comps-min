## Description
IBJJF Rules...but no advantages!


    The Winter Open will be competed under IBJJF rules, but without advantages. We believe that you should not be penalised for preventing a takedown or pass, and escaping a submission attempt - no matter how close it gets. These can also be subjective, awarded by the referees discretion.
  

    By removing advantages, you are merited for completing your passes, takedowns and submissions, and that's it!
  

    That being said, if a match ends in a draw, the referee will make a decision on who wins based on the entire match.
  

    Official ruleset can be found here.

  Consolation Matches
