Please
read the following rules and regulations to be followed by our Referee for any
Grapplers Grand Prix events.


Gi
& Uniforms


Ø  The Gis will not be checked or measured
before the tournament, but our referees have the right to ask a competitor to
change his/her Gi if the referee feels it is inappropriate.  This situation can happen if- the Gi is
obviously too short or too long, there are too many patches on the Gi
preventing the opponent from gripping it, the top and the pants are of
different colors or the Gi shows visible tears, is wet or dirty, or emanates
unpleasant odors.


Ø  Competitors may wear a rash guard under their
gi but no shirts.


Ø  For NoGi Men divisions, athletes have to wear
board shorts without pockets or with pockets entirely stitched shut and
reaching at least halfway down the thigh and at most to the knee. Attached
metal or plastic of any kind that may hurt the opponent is expressly forbidden
on the board shorts. Spats can be worn under the shorts if selected. Athletes
also must wear a rashguard. This rash guard or shirt does not need to meet any
color requirements. Athletes cannot compete shirtless or wearing a loose shirt
of any kind.


Ø  For NoGi Women divisions, athletes have to
wear board shorts or lycra elastic pants without pockets or with pockets
entirely stitched shut and reaching at least halfway down the thigh and at most
to the knee. Attached metal or plastic of any kind that may hurt the opponent
is expressly forbidden on the board shorts. Athletes also must wear a
rashguard. This rash guard does not need to meet any color requirements.
Athletes cannot compete wearing a loose shirt of any kind.


Hygiene


Ø  Athletes’ finger and toe nails should be
trimmed and short.


Ø  Long hair should be tied up so as not to
cause opponents any discomfort.


Ø  Athletes will be disqualified if they are
wearing hair dye or makeup that stains their opponent’s Gi or the mat surface
during a match.


Ø  Athletes presenting skin lesions, or any
other skin condition shall be directed to the tournament medical staff. Under
any circumstances, the medical staff has the final say on whether to allow an
athlete to compete or not.


Weigh-ins


Ø  You must check-in and weigh-in anytime up to
at least 60 minutes before your scheduled division start time. We ask that you
make sure to be present in the venue at least 60 minutes prior your division
start time as well in case we are able to get head starts on certain division.


Ø  There will be a 1-pound allowance.


Ø  If an athlete does not make weight on his
first attempt, he/she has until the end of the designated period to make
weight. Abusive usage of our scales (every five minutes) will not be permitted
though.


Ø  Athletes who fail to make weight during the
designated period will be disqualified and will not be moved up to another
weight division. Athletes who are disqualified will not be eligible for a
refund. It is the athlete’s responsibility to make the weight class they signed
up for, or have changed to a higher weight class by that event’s change
deadline.


Ø  All competitors competing in Gi divisions
weigh-in WITHOUT their Gi on.


Ø  An athlete who competes in both their Gi and
NoGi divisions only weigh-in once.


Extra
Requirements


Ø  Use of any foot gear, head gear, hair pins,
jewelry, cups (genital protectors) or any other protector fashioned of hard
material that may cause harm to an opponent or the athlete him/herself is
forbidden. Also forbidden is the use of head wear – be it bandages, hoods or an
elastic cap.


Ø  The use of joint protectors (knee, elbow
braces, etc.) that increase body volume to the point of making it harder for an
opponent to grip the Gi are also forbidden.


Competition
Guidelines


Match
Times


Ø  The time limit for every Adult fight in the
tournament, including the round robin & the finals, will be White Belt 5
Min, Blue & Purple 6 Min, Brown and Black 7 Min


Ø  The time limit for every Teens fight in the
tournament, including the round robin & the finals, will be 5 minutes.


Scoring


Ø  Matches follow traditional BJJ point scoring-
4 for the mount, 4 for the back, 3 for a guard pass, 2 for a takedown 2 for a
sweep, 2 for knee on belly, and 2 for a solid submission attempt that was stopped
out of bounds.


Ø  All positions must be held and controlled for
3 seconds.


Ø  There is no “Advantage” scoring.


Ø  A first penalty will result in a warning, a
second penalty will result in the opponent being given 2 points, a third
penalty will result in disqualification.


Ø  If a match finishes in a draw, the referee of
the match will declare a winner by Referee Decision at their discretion.


Ø  A match will be deemed over immediately if a
competitor taps out, screams, or verbally gives up during the match.


Awards


Ø  The three top-placed athletes in each
division shall receive medals. The champion shall receive a gold medal and the
runner-up shall receive a silver medal. A third-place fight will determine the
bronze medal winner.


Ø  The prizes shall be awarded according to the
results proclaimed by the referees. Exchanging placement at the moment prizes
are awarded is expressly forbidden.


Format


Ø  Competitors from every division will be
pooled with opponents within their own division for an opportunity of getting
up to 2 to 3 matches in a round robin or in a bracket of 6 or more it will be a
true double elimination allowing someone who loses his first match a chance to
win gold.


Ø  If a competitor has to forfeit some of his
matches, due to injury, his opponent will be declared the winner unless we can
match up competitors who were to face that opponent. Although we understand
perfectly that competitors might have to forfeit matches, we expect competitors
to complete all their matches as respect to their opponents.


Ø  Because of the round robin format, teammates
might end up being matched against one another. We put extra effort on such a
situation not happening but depending on the number of competitors or teammates
in a division, there might be no way to prevent it (Example- 5 competitors in a
division but 2 of them are teammates). Although we encourage teammates to face
each other, we also understand that some competitors might be adamant about not
doing it. We will allow teammates not to face each other but we absolutely need
a winner and a loser because of the round robin rankings.


Ø  In the case of tiebreakers, the following
algorithm will be utilized in order- Most Wins > Most Submissions > Head
To Head Match > Most Points Scored.
