Repeat Offenses- Continued sandbagging can lead to extended suspension or a complete ban from AGA tournaments.


Handling Children's Sandbagging- An educational approach will be taken for children. Their guardians and coaches will be counseled to ensure proper division placement.

Authority of Head Table- The Head Table has the sole authority to address sandbagging issues
