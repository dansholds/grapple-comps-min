HOW TO WEIGH-IN-


​To discourage unhealthy and potentially dangerous weight-cuts and diets, we do not hold weigh-ins on the night before our tournaments. We recommend our athletes compete in a weight division that falls under their normal everyday weight.


Weigh-ins are without the gi at the venue at assigned times before your division. Check the event page on our website for more info on the designated weigh-in times for Kids, Teens, and Adults.


There is a 1-pound allowance to account for undergarments and scale difference


If you miss your scheduled weigh-in time, you will be considered absent, your name will be removed from the brackets, and the bracket will be re-drawn.


If you do not make weight or do not weigh-in at least 15 minutes before your division begins, YOU WILL BE DISQUALIFIED FROM YOUR WEIGHT DIVISIONS. If you signed up for Absolute divisions, you may still compete in those in your weight allows (ex. If you signed up for the Absolute No-Gi 0-170 lbs., but you weigh-in over 170 lbs., you will be disqualified from your Absolute division too).


Please make sure you are at the weight you registered for, as there will be no refunds or transfers given due to disqualification or missing weight for any reason.


Competitors 13-years old and above may not change weight divisions on the day of the tournament as brackets will already be finalized and posted. If you know you need to change your weight division after you have registered, please contact us before 6PM on the Friday before the tournament to change divisions.
