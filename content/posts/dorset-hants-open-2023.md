<h3>FIGHT TIMES</h3>

<p>We will only know fight times once registration has closed and brackets have been created. We estimate to have this information around 21st September.</p>

<h3>MERGES</h3>

<p>We will be looking at the competitor list on 17th September and will start to make any necessary merges. Ideally, there should be at least 4 in a category in case someone does not show up, so fights can still go ahead. You also have the opportunity to merge/move yourself into another category on Check Day.</p>

<p>Moving Age Category for Adults - You can only move yourself to younger age groups.</p>
<p>Weight Category - You can only move yourself to heavier categories or to ones you know you can definitely make weight for.</p>

<h3>PARKING</h3>

<p>The first 3 hours are free parking at the Littledown Centre. Please purchase extra parking before the free 3 hours runs out otherwise you risk receiving an automatic fine from their camera system. Signs are displayed in the car park on how to purchase parking if needed.</p>
