## Description
Welcome to NOVA Grappling - Youth Open- Grappling Events You'll love!

All registrations will be processed online via Smoothcomp, so refer to registration instructions. Please register your child before the deadline which will be the 1st of September 2024.

Competition Rules


For children who fall into the PEE WEE 1&2 category (4 to 7 years old), there will be the option of entering an additional Novice NO SUBMISSIONS division. Matches can only be won via position and points or referee decision. If a child reaches a submission or illegal position they will not be disqualified but the match will be reset in a position the referee deems appropriate and both children will be allowed to finish the match.


For all other divisions, submissions that are LEGAL under IBJJF rules for their age group will be permitted. The match can be won via submission, points or referee decision. The safety of the competitor will always be the referee's main priority, if the referee feels that the submission is close they will end the match to ensure there is no injury to either child and declare the child applying the submission the winner.


Weigh-ins are done IN THE GI; competitors can weigh-in at any time from 9am.


Children may be moved up or down a category in weight or may be moved into a different belt category in order to make sure every bracket is well represented. We will always prioritise having kids in their correct category, but we also want to make sure everybody who enters gets the opportunity to compete against an opponent who has a similar level of experience and is close in weight.


We want to make sure all competitors that come to our competition get a fair opportunity to compete and most importantly enjoy their experience.


The Respect Rule


This event has a zero tolerance policy regarding inappropriate behaviour by coaches, parents/guardians, spectators and competitors.


All in attendance must show some restraint when their students or team mates are competing.


There will be competitors and spectators of all ages at this event and we are here to set an example. Any swearing, inappropriate gestures, violence (towards person or property) or berating the officials (regardless of any decisions they make) will not be tolerated.


If this happens, the referee/organiser has the right to disqualify that competitor, or to ask the coach to leave the area. If those concerned do not comply with the referee/organisers request the competitor will be disqualified from the event.


Refund Policy


No Refunds. We will offer credits to use against future events instead-
