## Description
Professor Vicente Junior is a 5th Degree BJJ Black Belt under the legendary Ricardo De La Riva. He is a World Gi and No Gi Champion, a 7x Pan American Champion, and one of the most sought after instructors in the World. Born in Sao Paulo Brazil Professor Luiz Vicente Junior began his career in martial arts not with Jiu-Jitsu, but in Judo. When Vicente was only fourteen years old he began his training with Judo and committed six years to that particular discipline, earning himself the rank of Brown Belt. It was not until later that Vicente was introduced to the art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu which is a martial art and combat sport that focuses on grappling and especially ground fighting with the goal of gaining a dominant position and using joint-locks and chokeholds to force an opponent to submit. Vicente has fully dedicated himself to this sport, training as often two or three times a day. His years of hard work and dedication to the sport have earned him the rank of 5th Degree De La Riva Black Belt.
