You will receive an NGA Coach’s Card that identifies you as a valuable member of your coaching staff. Present this card at any NGA event for free entry, free food voucher, and access to the coaching areas during competition. To apply for your free coaches card, at https://www.nga-bjj.com/general-4.


REFUNDS: Requests for refunds will be granted if submitted before February 10, 2024; however, from February 11, 2024 – February 29, 2024, voucher refunds shall be used for refunds to future events. Requests after the deadline will not be honored for any reason.


FORMAT: Multi-Stage Round-Robin, Best of One pool, Round-Robin, or best 2 of 3 brackets. It will depend on how many competitors are in your bracket. You will participate in a round-robin to maximize competitor matches. The top competitor in each round-robin pool will move on to a bracket format to determine the competitor’s placement. If there are only two competitors in one bracket, you may compete in a consolidated bracket or participate in a best out of three brackets.


MEDALS / PLACEMENT: Medals will be awarded to each division's first, second, and third-place finishers. Cash Money and 1st place medal will be given to the sole winner for the Adult Absolute No-Gi division and the remaining placers for 2nd and 3rd place.


TEAM AWARDS: Although this event will not have a team award, future NGA events will feature team awards to acknowledge excellence in overall team performance. In the interest of building and promoting a healthy Jiu-Jitsu community, we encourage school participation and active support for competitors from their coaches. Please let us know how to enhance competitor, coach, and spectator’s experiences at the competition.


BRACKET CONSOLIDATION: Any division with one competitor will be consolidated with another division, whether it requires the competitors to move up a weight or experience leveled class or has the opportunity to request a full refund before February 10, 2024.  Divisions with two competitors will compete against one another in a best 2 out of 3 division for placement. When there are three or more competitors, it will be a round-robin division. Then the best person from the round-robin goes on to the single elimination bracket portion if there are enough competitors. If not, it will strictly be a round-robin bracket.


The Adult Absolute No-Gi bracket shall be a single elimination bracket until the semi-finals, and then the two semi-finals losers shall compete for 3rd and 4th place.


***If you do not see your bracket, please contact us with your gender, age, weight, and belt or experience level at [email protected]. 


Depending on athlete turnout, NGA reserves the right to combine weight, age, and belt. Please note that 16-17 years old participants may get combined with the adult (18 years old and over) divisions depending on turnout and/or upon request from parents/guardians. Any request to move juveniles or Kids to Adults may be accepted, and any women requesting to move to male brackets may be approved if NGA accepts; However, liability is still the competitor's, coaches and parents of competitor's sole responsibility. All liability will be in accordance with NGA's waiver/liability policy.


CHANGING DIVISIONS: Competitors can change their division before March 1, 2024, at 8:00 pm EST. Once registrations close, any request to change divisions will not be granted. Depending on the change, competitors can modify their divisions by logging into their accounts and making the proper adjustments. If you have any issues or concerns about changing your division, please follow this link for additional guidance: https://support.smoothcomp.com/article/89-how-to-change-weightclass-or-cancel. 


BREAKS IN-BETWEEN MATCHES: It is the responsibility of the competitor or competitor’s coach to request a break if required. The break duration will be the same time as one regular match for your division. For example: If your matches are 5 minutes long, you must ask the ref for a 5-minute break only if you just finished another match in another division or in your current division. 


NO SHOW DISQUALIFICATIONS: To ensure fair and timely progression of the tournament, it is the collective responsibility of coaches, parents, and competitors to report to the ring when called for competition. An announcement will be made over the loudspeaker once for all competitors to report to the ring for their division. Once the division matches commence, competitors will be called onto the mat to compete. Competitors that fail to respond to the initial mat call will be announced over the loudspeaker. The competitor has one minute to report to the mat to complete. Failure to do so will result in the opponent receiving a “walkover” win per the referee’s decision. Once the winner is announced, the decision will not be reversed under any circumstances; nor will the missing competitor be permitted to participate in an alternate division in lieu of the missed match. Matches can be monitored on Smoothcomp.com or on the TV table that will display all mats and who is on deck to compete. 


WEIGH-INS: All kids competing can start to weigh in once the doors are open. Kid's matches will start at 9:00 am EST. Adults should start to arrive before or at 10:00 am EST and weigh in one hour before their first match in case the kid's brackets finish early.


CORNER COACHES & CROWD CONTROL: Every mat will have a chair or tapped-off corner for each competitor’s coach. Only one coach is allowed in the coaching area next to the mat. Spectators are prohibited from entering the coaching or competition area. All kid division matches will not start until at least one coach or another competitor from their school is present. For adults, it is highly recommended, although not mandatory, that adult competitors have a coach present during their match. The only other people allowed in the mat area are the coaches, the competitors on the mat, and the competitors on deck. Everyone else is asked to be in the seating area away from the mats. Coaches are required to remove their shoes before stepping on mat spaces.


MEDIC: Medical staff will be available during the entire competition. \General first aid care will be available. Please seek the onsite medical staff for assistance as necessary.


WARM-UP AREA: Mat space will be available for warming up. Please be courteous to fellow competitors and share this space, as space is limited. To keep the warmup and competition mats clean, please refrain from wearing shoes on the mats. 


LIVE DIVISION UPDATES: All divisions will be displayed on a monitor with live updates of each mat and who will compete on them and for those on deck and in the hole.


RANKINGS: Competitors will be awarded points for wins, submission wins, walk-over wins, and for placing in the top three of each division. These points will help with the future ranking of competitors for future tournaments.


SPONSORING A CHARITY: Members at the National Grappling Association love giving back to local communities and charities. We are interested in partnering with charity at each event to bring awareness to their cause to better the community. If you are a charity looking to partner with NGA, please email us at [email protected] and put “CHARITY PARTNERSHIP” in the subject line. Please provide a brief synopsis of your organization, what you seek to accomplish, and contact information.


EVENT STAFF: The National Grappling Association always looks for Referees or table workers to help expedite the tournament. To be a referee, you must be a Purple Belt or higher. Opportunities are available for Jiu-Jitsu practitioners of any rank and other interested individuals. You want to compete and work; we offer discounts on entry fees for those who help. If you’re an adult competing, you will be utilized mainly during the kid’s competition and switch once the kids are done so you can solely focus on your matches. If interested, please email [email protected] and put “WORKER” in the subject line. 


Thank You
