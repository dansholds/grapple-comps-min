POLARIS GRAND PRIX RULES


Bout Duration: 6 minutes


Method of victory: Submission or Points or Referee Decision in case of draw


1 point each awarded for: Takedown


Pass guard


Back control (including body triangle) 


Mount


Sweep


Single competitor stalling: 


Referee notices stalling and starts stalling timer.


30 seconds of stalling = official warning


Next 30 seconds of stalling = other competitor can choose dominant position (BACK, SIDE CONTROL, MOUNT)


If both competitors are stalling:


Referee notices stalling and starts stalling timer.


30 seconds of stalling = official warning


Next 30 seconds of stalling =


– If the stalling is taking place on the ground, both competitors will be forced to stand


– If the stalling is taking place standing, both competitors will be forced to start in the combat base position half a metre apart


If both competitors are warned for stalling but then only one competitor continues to stall, then conditions revert to ‘single competitor stalling’ guidelines


In a “one up one down” situation eg one competitor in seated guard, one competitor trying to pass, the competitor who is moving backwards will be considered the one who is stalling.


All stalling calls are reset once the athlete or athletes stop stalling.


“STALEMATE” RulePolaris is grappling entertainment, with paying viewers. If a position is deemed a stalemate, the referee may interrupt and force a reset or other break in action, at his or her sole discretion. A stalemate can be called in ANY position (standing, half guard, full guard, mount, etc) where the action does not proceed, either to a more dominant position OR a submission.


Further details / Clarifications 


Pulling guard must be initiated with contact first.


Stalling = failing to advance position or initiate serious attempts to finish or score points.


Loss of position while actively attacking a submission will not result in a point for the opponent. For example if you sit back for a footlock from standing position against a supine opponent, and the opponent comes up as a response to the attack, the opponent will not receive a point for the sweep.


Standing from double guard pull will not be rewarded with a point for a sweep.


Takedown


Must put the opponent’s back or side or butt on the mat and keep the top position for 3 seconds. 


Pass Guard 


Must pass the opponent’s legs and stabilise a control position unimpeded for 3 seconds. 


Back Control Including Triangling the Legs


Must have either both hooks in or legs triangled for 3 seconds, with control of the upper body. 


Mount and Back Mount


Mounted position with legs clear, opponent can be face up or face down. 


Sweep


Any sweep from any guard resulting in a change of position from bottom to top of the person doing the sweep, and stabilising for 3 seconds. 


Reversals (from under a dominant position or in when a submission) are not counted as points. 


No advantages given for close attempts or positions that are lost or not secured due to scrambles. 


Referee setup


Main referee on mat


2 side referees


Competitors have either red or blue wristbands

Main referee’s job is to signal points using appropriate wristband


Points can be waved off by side refs if both agree
