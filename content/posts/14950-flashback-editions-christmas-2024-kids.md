ARRIVAL TIME


You only have to be at the event 30 minutes  before you fight to sign in, warm up and be ready to be weighed in.  


FIGHT TIMES


We will only know fight times once registration has closed and brackets have been created. We estimate to have this information around 28th November.


MERGES


We will be looking at the competitor list on 24th November and will start to make any necessary merges.  Ideally there should be at least 4 in a category in case someone does not show up, so fights can still go ahead. You also have the opportunity to merge/move yourself into another category on Check Day.


VENUE

PARKING


There are local car parks about 6 minute walk away. Or there is street parking opposite and down the residential side roads.
