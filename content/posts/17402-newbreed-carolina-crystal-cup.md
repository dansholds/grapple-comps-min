## Description
This Summer NJJF is bringing the Carolina Crystal Cup to Charlotte for the first time! Join us August 31st at Carolina Courts in Indian Trail for one of our most anticipated tournaments of the year. Rally the team and come out strong for your chance to take home the prestigious Crystal Cup!


This tournament welcomes practitioners of all levels, from beginners to seasoned
veterans. Whether you prefer gi or nogi, we've got you covered.
Regardless of your age or skill level, this tournament provides an
opportunity for everyone to showcase their skills and ignite their
passion for jiu jitsu.


At NEWBREED, excellence deserves recognition.
The top three athletes in
each division will be awarded limited edition Crystal Cup medals. Stand tall on the podium and receive a symbol of your
achievement—a medal that represents your dedication, skill, and
unwavering commitment.


First-place winners in any advanced division will receive the
prestigious NJJF Championship Belt. This honor is reserved for those who
demonstrate exceptional mastery and sheer determination. Will you be
the one to claim the belt and solidify your place among the jiu jitsu
elite?


For those seeking the ultimate test of skill and versatility, step up to the NOGI Absolute Division. Compete
against the best, regardless of weight class or rank, and vie for the
title of absolute champion. This is your chance to push your limits,
display your adaptability, and leave an indelible mark on the jiu jitsu
community.


Team points are calculated to determine the top
three teams in both the youth and adult categories, as well as the
overall team champion. Gather your teammates, showcase your collective
strength, and etch your team's name in the records of jiu jitsu history.


All seven teams will receive an impressive award banner to proudly hang
in their academy. This emblem of achievement will serve as a constant
reminder of the dedication and teamwork that brought you to the podium.
The first-place winning teams will be presented with the prestigious
Crystal Cup trophies!
