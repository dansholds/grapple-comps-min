MULTIPLE DIVISIONS FOR CHILDREN & TEENS


Children and teen competitors who want to compete in an additional higher weight class or older age group division can do so for $20 per division. You can add one additional weight class or age group per division type (no-gi or gi) for a total of 4 divisions. Competitors CANNOT do multiple skill levels.


As an example: a beginner 11 year old 85 pound competitor could add the 90-99.9 weight class OR the 12-13 year old category (not both). They cannot add the intermediate skill level. They can do this for no-gi, gi, or both. It is $20 for each division added. If they wanted to go up in weight for no-gi and up in age for gi (or vice-versa) we can accommodate that request.


If you would like to add an additional division (or two), text the office at (814) 221-0806 or email [email protected]. The following information is required in order to add the extra division(s): which tournament, the competitor’s name, up age or up weight, no-gi/gi/both, payment method (credit card, PayPal, Stripe), and the email address (only needed if you are texting in). Nevada Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Federation Championship will email you an invoice with a link to pay for the extra divisions. Once payment is made we will copy the competitor into the additional division(s).
