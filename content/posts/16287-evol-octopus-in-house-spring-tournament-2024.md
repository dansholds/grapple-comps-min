## Description
Welcome!


This is a event for Evol Octopus Jiu-Jitsu members only. Others that manage to register will be unable to complete registration and will be removed. We will be hosting open tournaments in the near future so stay tuned!


This event is preparation for the AGF Tri-Cities tournament held on May 18th.


5216 Outlet Dr. Pasco, WA 99301


This event is a Gi and No Gi Single Elimination format following very closely to the American Grappling Federation (AGF). The (4-7 year olds) that participate in our Little Squids classes will follow a positional point scoring system with no submissions and they will be only competing in a Gi. 


Doors Open April 6th  8-00 A.M. All youth athletes are expected to arrive and check in by 8-30 A.M.


Matches will start at 9-00 A.M. with the youngest athletes first and end with adults. 


No Gi Uniform- Athletes must wear shorts with NO pockets, NO zippers or Buttons. male athletes can wear spats but must wear "courtesy" shorts as well. Athletes must wear rash guards or athletic shirts, no t-shirts will be allowed. 


Gi Uniform- Clean and untorn Gi's of all colors are allowed. 


Matchmaking- Our goal is to make sure your athletes have the most mathes possible and we reserve the right to combine divisons we feel will provide the best competition and experience for your athletes. 


At the end of the event we will have an award ceremony, presenting medals to 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winners as well as performance awards. We wait until the end so people stay and cheer on their teamates and the best experience is provided.
