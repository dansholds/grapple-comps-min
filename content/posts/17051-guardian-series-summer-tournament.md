Welcome to the Guardian Series


THE GUARDIAN SERIES STORY


We are a group of jiu-jitsu parents who decided to create a free tournament the whole family can enjoy. We can't wait for you to experience the Guardian Series, where we support and encourage our kids as they step out to test their skills, celebrate their victories and - most importantly - learn from the process. 


We are a non-profit organization designed to benefit all kids. We survive on sponsorships and donations which are both tax deductible. If you want to support our vision to bring jiu jitsu to all please email [email protected]. 


The Guardian Series is a double elimination tournament. Every competitor will have a minimum of two G and 2 No-Gi matches. Registration is free for all competitors and free entry for all spectators. Space is limited  so register early. There is no waitlist, once full. 


The first two minutes of each match will be submission only with the remaining time following the points system. The basic concept of double elimination is similar to single elimination, in which there are multiple rounds, and the winners advance in the primary brackets. The difference is that when an athlete loses a fight, they move to the secondary bracket where they compete for third place. In this system, the athlete who wins all fights receives the gold medal, the competitor who loses in the final round receives the silver medal, and the winner of the secondary bracket of athletes who suffered a defeat receives the bronze medal.


The tournament will begin at 9-30 am and doors open at 8-30 am.
