# Hi, Welcome To Grapple Comps!
<br></br>
We want the process of finding your next competition easy (and look good too ðŸ’…).
<br></br>
## How To Use
<br></br>
We have aimed to make the process of identifying your next competition as easy as possible! Each "comp card" will display four main elements:
<ul>
<li>Comp Name</li>
<li>Date</li>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Price</li>
</ul>

Each card will also contain the following tags, which you can filter for:
<ul>
<li>Month</Li>
<li>Ruleset i.e. IBJJF, ADCC</li>
<li>Gi and/or No-Gi</li>
<li>Whether there is a kids bracket</li>
</ul>

When you chose a comp and go through to the dedicated page, you will see more information such as description, accurate location & most importantly,<strong> the sign up link</strong>.
<br></br>

### Future features;
<ul>
<li>Filter by multiple tags</li>
<li>Google Maps integration</li>
<li>Submit a comp</li>
<li>Submit a seminar/event (paid)</li>
</ul>
